A threshold was reached, as if a space alien suddenly appeared that could communicate with us in an eerily human way.…Some aspects of their behavior appear to be intelligent, but if it’s not human intelligence, what is the nature of their intelligence?”}}

    abstract = "The increased deployment of LMs for real-world tasks involving knowledge and facts makes it important to understand model epistemology: what LMs think they know, and how their attitudes toward that knowledge are affected by language use in their inputs. Here, we study an aspect of model epistemology: how epistemic markers of certainty, uncertainty, or evidentiality like {``}I{'}m sure it{'}s{''}, {``}I think it{'}s{''}, or {``}Wikipedia says it{'}s{''} affect models, and whether they contribute to model failures. We develop a typology of epistemic markers and inject 50 markers into prompts for question answering. We find that LMs are highly sensitive to epistemic markers in prompts, with accuracies varying more than 80{\%}. Surprisingly, we find that expressions of high certainty result in a 7{\%} decrease in accuracy as compared to low certainty expressions; similarly, factive verbs hurt performance, while evidentials benefit performance. Our analysis of a popular pretraining dataset shows that these markers of uncertainty are associated with answers on question-answering websites, while markers of certainty are associated with questions. These associations may suggest that the behavior of LMs is based on mimicking observed language use, rather than truly reflecting epistemic uncertainty.",

               survey that suggests six broad categories of linguistic factors
               that lead humans to anthropomorphize robots: autonomy,
               adaptability, directness, politeness, proportionality, and humor.
               By contextualizing these six factors through the lens of Jackson
               and Williams' Theory of Social Agency for Human-Robot
               Interaction, we are able to show how and why these particular
               factors are those responsible for language-based robot
               anthropomorphism.},

  author        ={Chien, Jennifer and Danks, David},
  journal       ={arXiv [cs.CY]},
  abstract      ={Algorithmic harms are commonly categorized as either
                   allocative or representational. This study specifically
                   addresses the latter, focusing on an examination of current
                   definitions of representational harms to discern what is
                   included and what is not. This analysis motivates our
                   expansion beyond behavioral definitions to encompass harms to
                   cognitive and affective states. The paper outlines high-level
                   requirements for measurement: identifying the necessary
                   expertise to implement this approach and illustrating it
                   through a case study. Our work highlights the unique
                   vulnerabilities of large language models to perpetrating
                   representational harms, particularly when these harms go
                   unmeasured and unmitigated. The work concludes by presenting
                   proposed mitigations and delineating when to employ them. The
                   overarching aim of this research is to establish a framework
                   for broadening the definition of representational harms and
                   to translate insights from fairness research into practical
                   measurement and mitigation praxis.},

  abstract  ={With the continuous improvement of large language models (LLMs),
               chatbots can produce coherent and continuous word sequences that
               mirror natural human language. While the use of natural language
               and human-like conversation styles enables the use of chatbots
               within a range of everyday settings, these usability-enhancing
               features can also have unintended consequences, such as making
               fallible information seem trustworthy by emphasizing friendliness
               and closeness. This can have serious implications for information
               retrieval tasks performed with chatbots. In this paper, we
               provide an overview of the literature on parasociality, social
               affordance, and trust to bridge these concepts within human-AI
               interactions. We critically examine how chatbot roleplaying and
               user role projection co-produce a pseudo-interactive,
               technologically-mediated space with imbalanced dynamics between
               users and chatbots. Based on the review of the literature, we
               develop a conceptual framework of parasociality in chatbots that
               describes interactions between humans and anthropomorphized
               chatbots. We dissect how chatbots use personal pronouns,
               conversational conventions, affirmations, and similar strategies
               to position the chatbots as users companions or assistants, and
               how these tactics induce trust-forming behaviors in users.
               Finally, based on the conceptual framework, we outline a set of
               ethical concerns that emerge from parasociality, including
               illusions of reciprocal engagement, task misalignment, and leaks
               of sensitive information. This paper argues that these possible
               consequences arise from a positive feedback cycle wherein
               anthropomorphized chatbot features encourage users to fill in the
               context around predictive outcomes.},

    abstract ={Anthropomorphism, or the attribution of human-like characteristics to non-human entities, has shaped conversations about the impacts and possibilities of technology. We present AnthroScore, an automatic metric of implicit anthropomorphism in language. We use a masked language model to quantify how non-human entities are implicitly framed as human by the surrounding context. We show that AnthroScore corresponds with human judgments of anthropomorphism and dimensions of anthropomorphism described in social science literature. Motivated by concerns of misleading anthropomorphism in computer science discourse, we use AnthroScore to analyze 15 years of research papers and downstream news articles. In research papers, we find that anthropomorphism has steadily increased over time, and that papers related to language models have the most anthropomorphism. Within ACL papers, temporal increases in anthropomorphism are correlated with key neural advancements. Building upon concerns of scientific misinformation in mass media, we identify higher levels of anthropomorphism in news headlines compared to the research papers they cite. Since AnthroScore is lexicon-free, it can be directly applied to a wide range of text sources.},

    abstract = "Automated dialogue or conversational systems are anthropomorphised by developers and personified by users. While a degree of anthropomorphism is inevitable, conscious and unconscious design choices can guide users to personify them to varying degrees. Encouraging users to relate to automated systems as if they were human can lead to transparency and trust issues, and high risk scenarios caused by over-reliance on their outputs. As a result, natural language processing researchers have investigated the factors that induce personification and develop resources to mitigate such effects. However, these efforts are fragmented, and many aspects of anthropomorphism have yet to be explored. In this paper, we discuss the linguistic factors that contribute to the anthropomorphism of dialogue systems and the harms that can arise thereof, including reinforcing gender stereotypes and conceptions of acceptable language. We recommend that future efforts towards developing dialogue systems take particular care in their design, development, release, and description; and attend to the many linguistic cues that can elicit personification by users.",

title = {From AI to Probabilistic Automation: How Does Anthropomorphization of Technical Systems Descriptions Influence Trust?},

abstract = {In this paper we investigate how peoples level of trust (as reported through self-assessment) in so-called AI (artificial intelligence) is influenced by anthropomorphizing language in system descriptions. Building on prior work, we define four categories of anthropomorphization (1. Properties of a cognizer, 2. Agency, 3. Biological metaphors, and 4. Properties of a communicator). We use a survey-based approach (n=954) to investigate whether participants are likely to trust one of two (fictitious) AI systems by randomly assigning people to see either an anthropomorphized or a de-anthropomorphized description of the systems. We find that participants are no more likely to trust anthropomorphized over de-anthropmorphized product descriptions overall. The type of product or system in combination with different anthropomorphic categories appears to exert greater influence on trust than anthropomorphizing language alone, and age is the only demographic factor that significantly correlates with peoples preference for anthropomorphized or de-anthropomorphized descriptions. When elaborating on their choices, participants highlight factors such as lesser of two evils, lower or higher stakes contexts, and human favoritism as driving motivations when choosing between product A and B, irrespective of whether they saw an anthropomorphized or a de-anthropomorphized description of the product. Our results suggest that anthropomorphism in AI descriptions is an aggregate concept that may influence different groups differently, and provide nuance to the discussion of whether anthropomorphization leads to higher trust and over-reliance by the general public in systems sold as AI.},
