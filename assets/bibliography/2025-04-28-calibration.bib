 abstract = {Suppose that a forecaster sequentially assigns probabilities to events. He is well calibrated if, for example, of those events to which he assigns a probability 30 percent, the long-run proportion that actually occurs turns out to be 30 percent. We prove a theorem to the effect that a coherent Bayesian expects to be well calibrated, and consider its destructive implications for the theory of coherence.},
