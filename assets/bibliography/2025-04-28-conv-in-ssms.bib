  abstract = 	 {The state-of-the-art memory model is the General Associative Memory Model, a generalization of the classical Hopfield network. Like its ancestor, the general associative memory has a well-defined state-dependant energy surface, and its memories correlate with its fixed points. This is unlike human memories, which are commonly sequential rather than separated fixed points. In this paper, we introduce a class of General Sequential Episodic Memory Models (GSEMM) that, in the adiabatic limit, exhibit a dynamic energy surface, leading to a series of meta-stable states capable of encoding memory sequences. A multiple-timescale architecture enables the dynamic nature of the energy surface with newly introduced asymmetric synapses and signal propagation delays. We demonstrate its dense capacity under polynomial activation functions. GSEMM combines separate memories, short and long sequential episodic memories, under a unified theoretical framework, demonstrating how energy-based memory modeling can provide richer, human-like episodes.}

    abstract = {Activity in neural circuits is spatiotemporally organized. Its spatial organization consists of multiple, localized coherent patterns, or patchy clusters. These patterns propagate across the circuits over time. This type of collective behavior has ubiquitously been observed, both in spontaneous activity and evoked responses; its function, however, has remained unclear. We construct a spatially extended, spiking neural circuit that generates emergent spatiotemporal activity patterns, thereby capturing some of the complexities of the patterns observed empirically. We elucidate what kind of fundamental function these patterns can serve by showing how they process information. As self-sustained objects, localized coherent patterns can signal information by propagating across the neural circuit. Computational operations occur when these emergent patterns interact, or collide with each other. The ongoing behaviors of these patterns naturally embody both distributed, parallel computation and cascaded logical operations. Such distributed computations enable the system to work in an inherently flexible and efficient way. Our work leads us to propose that propagating coherent activity patterns are the underlying primitives with which neural circuits carry out distributed dynamical computation.},

abstract = {Abstract The main object of this study was to see whether ordered sequences of orientation columns are present in very young visually naive monkeys. Recordings were made from area 17 in two macaque monkeys three and four weeks of age, whose eyes had been closed near the time of birth. The first monkey was born normally, but one day elapsed before eye closure could be done. The second was delivered by Cesarean section and the lids sutured shut immediately. The results in these two animals were very similar; in both, highly ordered sequences of orientation shifts were present, and were in no obvious way different from those seen in the adult. For example, average values for the size of orientation shifts, for the horizontal component of the distance between shifts, and for the slopes of orientation vs. track distance curves, were all similar to adult values. This indicates that the ordered column system is innately determined and not the result of early visual experience. In these two monkeys and a third one, sutured at two days and examined at 38 days, most of the cells seemed normal by adult standards, with simple, complex or hypercomplex receptive fields, showing about the same range in orientation specificity as is found in adults. About 10–15\% of cells showed abnormalities similar to those seen in monkeys binocularly deprived of vision for longer periods. Furthermore, all three deprived monkeys showed a decided lack of cells that could be influenced from both eyes, whereas a normal three-week-old control animal seemed similar to the adult, with binocular cells comprising over half of the total population. A monkey deprived by binocular closure from the third to the seventh week also showed a diminution in number of binocularly influenced cells, suggesting that the deprivation from birth resulted in a deterioration of innate connections subserving binocular convergence. To be sure that the abnormalities in the deprived animals represented a deterioration of connections, we recorded from 23 cells in a normal two-day-old monkey: here the ocular dominance distribution of cells was about the same as in the adult, and the response characteristics of the cells were normal by adult standards.},

	abstract = {A salient characteristic of monkey inferior temporal (IT) cortex is the IT face processing network. Its hallmarks include: {\textquotedblleft}face neurons{\textquotedblright} that respond more to faces than non-face objects, strong spatial clustering of those neurons in foci at each IT anatomical level ({\textquotedblleft}face patches{\textquotedblright}), and the preferential interconnection of those foci. While some deep artificial neural networks (ANNs) are good predictors of IT neuronal responses, including face neurons, they do not explain those face network hallmarks. Here we ask if they might be explained with a simple, metabolically motivated addition to current ANN ventral stream models. Specifically, we designed and successfully trained topographic deep ANNs (TDANNs) to solve real-world visual recognition tasks (as in prior work), but, in addition, we also optimized each network to minimize a proxy for neuronal wiring length within its IT layers. We report that after this dual optimization, the model IT layers of TDANNs reproduce the hallmarks of the IT face network: the presence of face neurons, clusters of face neurons that quantitatively match those found in IT face patches, connectivity between those patches, and the emergence of face viewpoint invariance along the network hierarchy. We find that these phenomena emerge for a range of naturalistic experience, but not for highly unnatural training. Taken together, these results show that the IT face processing network could be a consequence of a basic hierarchical anatomy along the ventral stream, selection pressure on the visual system to accomplish general object categorization, and selection pressure to minimize axonal wiring length.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Yet, the neural mechanisms that may allow such dynamic routing of the information flow are not yet fully understood. We investigated the role of gamma band (50–80 Hz) oscillations in transient modulations of communication among neural populations by using measures of direction-specific causal information transfer. We found that the local phase of gamma-band rhythmic activity exerted a stimulus-modulated and spatially-asymmetric directed effect on the firing rate of spatially separated populations within the primary visual cortex. The relationships between gamma phases at different sites (phase shifts) could be described as a stimulus-modulated gamma-band wave propagating along the spatial directions with the largest information transfer. We observed transient stimulus-related changes in the spatial configuration of phases (compatible with changes in direction of gamma wave propagation) accompanied by a relative increase of the amount of information flowing along the instantaneous direction of the gamma wave. These effects were specific to the gamma-band and suggest that the time-varying relationships between gamma phases at different locations mark, and possibly causally mediate, the dynamic reconfiguration of functional connections.},

 abstract = {A mathematical model is proposed to describe the formation of orientation columns in mammalian visual cortex. The model is similar in concept to that proposed for ocular dominance column formation (Swindale 1980), the essential difference being that orientation is a vector rather than a scalar variable. It is assumed that initially orientation selectivity is weak and randomly distributed, and that selectivity develops in such a way that the orientation preferences of neurons less than about 200 μ m apart tend to change in a similar direction, whereas the preferences of cells further apart tend to develop in opposite directions. No hypotheses are made about the anatomical or physiological basis of these interactions, and it is not necessary to assume that they are the result of environmental stimulation, as with existing models for the the development of orientation selectivity (see, for example, von der Malsburg, 1973). The model reproduces the experimental data on orientation columns: roughly linear sequences of orientation change are produced, and these alternate unpredictably between clockwise and anticlockwise directions of change. Continuous sequences may span several 180 degrees cycles of rotation. The sequences are generally smooth, but abrupt discontinuities of up to 90 degrees also occur. The iso-orientation domains for large orientation ranges (60-90 degrees) are periodically spaced branching stripes that resemble those demonstrated in animals by the 2-deoxyglucose technique. The domains for narrower orientation ranges are periodically spaced but are more irregular in shape, though sometimes thin and elongated. The model makes a number of predictions that can be tested experimentally. Of particular interest are the discontinuities in the orientation sequences: these should be distributed with a spacing roughly equal to, or half, that of the iso-orientation domains. Each should be surrounded by one or two complete sets of iso-orientation domains, and each may be associated with regions where cells are not orientation selective. These regions may be more extensive in younger animals, when the columns are at an intermediate stage of formation, and less numerous where the columns run parallel and unbranched over large areas.},

(p. 1113, published online 4 November; see the Perspective by Miller) looked at the organization of orientation columns in diverse placental mammals and discovered a similarity of organizational principles. Analysis of evolutionarily divergent species highlights constraint on brain structure imposed by self-organizing neural networks. The brain’s visual cortex processes information concerning form, pattern, and motion within functional maps that reflect the layout of neuronal circuits. We analyzed functional maps of orientation preference in the ferret, tree shrew, and galago—three species separated since the basal radiation of placental mammals more than 65 million years ago—and found a common organizing principle. A symmetry-based class of models for the self-organization of cortical networks predicts all essential features of the layout of these neuronal circuits, but only if suppressive long-range interactions dominate development. We show mathematically that orientation-selective long-range connectivity can mediate the required interactions. Our results suggest that self-organization has canalized the evolution of the neuronal circuitry underlying orientation preference maps into a single common design.}}

abstract = {During sleep, the thalamus generates a characteristic pattern of transient, 11-15 Hz sleep spindle oscillations, which synchronize the cortex through large-scale thalamocortical loops. Spindles have been increasingly demonstrated to be critical for sleep-dependent consolidation of memory, but the specific neural mechanism for this process remains unclear. We show here that cortical spindles are spatiotemporally organized into circular wave-like patterns, organizing neuronal activity over tens of milliseconds, within the timescale for storing memories in large-scale networks across the cortex via spike-time dependent plasticity. These circular patterns repeat over hours of sleep with millisecond temporal precision, allowing reinforcement of the activity patterns through hundreds of reverberations. These results provide a novel mechanistic account for how global sleep oscillations and synaptic plasticity could strengthen networks distributed across the cortex to store coherent and integrated memories.},

abstract = {Electrode recordings and imaging studies have revealed that localized visual stimuli elicit waves of activity that travel across primary visual cortex. Traveling waves are present also during spontaneous activity, but they can be greatly reduced by widespread and intensive visual stimulation. In this Review, we summarize the evidence in favor of these traveling waves. We suggest that their substrate may lie in long-range horizontal connections and that their functional role may involve the integration of information over large regions of space.}
