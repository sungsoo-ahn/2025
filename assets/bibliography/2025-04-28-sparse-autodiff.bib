CasADi is a general-purpose tool that can be used to model and solve optimization problems with a large degree of flexibility, larger than what is associated with popular algebraic modeling languages such as AMPL, GAMS, JuMP or Pyomo. Of special interest are problems constrained by differential equations, i.e. optimal control problems. CasADi is written in self-contained C++, but is most conveniently used via full-featured interfaces to Python, MATLAB or Octave. Since its inception in late 2009, it has been used successfully for academic teaching as well as in applications from multiple fields, including process control, robotics and aerospace. This article gives an up-to-date and accessible introduction to the CasADi framework, which has undergone numerous design improvements over the last 7~years.},

Two of these implement the forward accumulation approach while the third employs reverse accumulation. Each package is used to provide gradient information required by a number of optimization calculations, including examples of unconstrained, constrained and least-squares problems. The results show how automatic differentiation methods can be influenced in practice by the size, complexity and sparsity of a problem. They also demonstrate ways in which the methods should interface with different types of optimization procedure. Finally, and perhaps most significantly, the results show how the performance of automatic differentiation codes can depend on hardware and system software considerations that are sometimes ignored by numerical mathematicians. A subsidiary aim of this paper is to provide a ``shop window'' for user friendly forms of automatic differentiation. The underlying mathematical ideas have been quite widely discussed in the literature: but their implementation and use seems to have been perceived as too difficult for the non-specialist. The examples in this paper are intended to demonstrate that this need not be the case},

Automatic differentiation (AD), also called algorithmic differentiation or simply {\^a}autodiff{\^a}, is a family of techniques similar to but more general than backpropagation for efficiently and accurately evaluating derivatives of numeric functions expressed as computer programs. AD is a small but established field with applications in areas including computational fluid dynamics, atmospheric sciences, and engineering design optimization. Until very recently, the fields of machine learning and AD have largely been unaware of each other and, in some cases, have independently discovered each other's results.

We survey the intersection of AD and machine learning, cover applications where AD has direct relevance, and address the main implementation techniques. By precisely defining the main differentiation techniques and their interrelationships, we aim to bring clarity to the usage of the terms {\^a}autodiff{\^a}, {\^a}automatic differentiation{\^a}, and {\^a}symbolic differentiation{\^a} as these are encountered more and more in machine learning settings.},

Algorithmic differentiation (AD) greatly reduces the programming effort required to obtain the sparsity patterns and values for these matrices. We present forward, reverse, and subgraph methods for computing sparse Jacobians and Hessians. Special attention is given the the subgraph method because it is new. The coloring and compression steps are not necessary when computing sparse Jacobians and Hessians using subgraphs. Complexity analysis shows that for some problems the subgraph method is expected to be much faster. We compare C++ operator overloading implementations of the methods in the ADOL-C and CppAD software packages using some of the MINPACK-2 test problems. The experiments are set up in a way that makes them easy to run on different hardware, different systems, different compilers, other test problem and other AD packages. The setup time is the time to record the graph, compute sparsity, coloring, compression, and optimization of the graph. If the setup is necessary for each evaluation, the subgraph implementation has similar run times for sparse Jacobians and faster run times for sparse Hessians.},

Both the accuracy and the computational requirements of the derivative computation are usually of critical importance for the robustness and speed of the numerical solution. Automatic Differentiation of FORtran (ADIFOR) is a source transformation tool that accepts Fortran 77 code for the computation of a function and writes portable Fortran 77 code for the computation of the derivatives. In contrast to previous approaches, ADIFOR views automatic differentiation as a source transformation problem. ADIFOR employs the data analysis capabilities of the ParaScope Parallel Programming Environment, which enable us to handle arbitrary Fortran 77 codes and to exploit the computational context in the computation of derivatives. Experimental results show that ADIFOR can handle real-life codes and that ADIFOR-generated codes are competitive with divided-difference approximations of derivatives. In addition, studies suggest that the source transformation approach to automatic differentiation may improve the time to compute derivatives by orders of magnitude.},

For simple functions, symbolic differentiation--done either manually or with a computer algebra system--can provide the derivatives, whereas divided differences (DD) have been used traditionally for functions defined by (potentially very complex) computer programs, even if only approximate values can be obtained this way. An alternative approach for such functions is automatic differentiation (AD), yielding exact derivatives at often lower cost than DD, and without restrictions on the program complexity. In this paper we compare the functionality and describe the use of ADMIT/ADMAT and ADiMat. These two AD tools provide derivatives for programs written in the MATLAB language, which is widely used for prototype and production software in scientific and engineering applications. While ADMIT/ADMAT implements a pure operator overloading approach of AD, ADiMat also employes source transformation techniques.},

  abstract = {Automatic differentiation (AD) is a technique that augments computer codes with statements for the computation of derivatives. The computational workhorse of AD-generated codes for first-order derivatives is the linear combination of vectors. For many large-scale problems, the vectors involved in this operation are inherently sparse. If the underlying function is a partially separable one (e.g., if its Hessian is sparse), many of the intermediate gradient vectors computed by AD will also be sparse, even though the final gradient is likely to be dense. For large Jacobians computations, every intermediate derivative vector is usually at least as sparse as the least sparse row of the final Jacobian. In this paper, we show that dynamic exploitation of the sparsity inherent in derivative computation can result in dramatic gains in runtime and memory savings. For a set of gradient problems exhibiting implicit sparsity, we report on the runtime and memory requirements of computing the gradients with the ADIFOR (Automatic Differentiation of FORtran) tool, both with and without employing the SparsLinC (Sparse Linear Combinations) library, and show that SparsLinC can reduce runtime and memory costs by orders of magnitude. We also compute sparse Jacobians using the SparsLinC-based approach --- in the process, automatically detecting the sparsity structure of the Jacobian --- and show that these Jacobian results compare favorably with those of previous techniques that require a priori knowledge of the sparsity structure of the Jacobian},

  abstract = {Automatic differentiation (autodiff) has revolutionized machine learning. It allows to express complex computations by composing elementary ones in creative ways and removes the burden of computing their derivatives by hand. More recently, differentiation of optimization problem solutions has attracted widespread attention with applications such as optimization layers, and in bi-level problems such as hyper-parameter optimization and meta-learning. However, so far, implicit differentiation remained difficult to use for practitioners, as it often required case-by-case tedious mathematical derivations and implementations. In this paper, we propose automatic implicit differentiation, an efficient and modular approach for implicit differentiation of optimization problems. In our approach, the user defines directly in Python a function \$F\$ capturing the optimality conditions of the problem to be differentiated. Once this is done, we leverage autodiff of \$F\$ and the implicit function theorem to automatically differentiate the optimization problem. Our approach thus combines the benefits of implicit differentiation and autodiff. It is efficient as it can be added on top of any state-of-the-art solver and modular as the optimality condition specification is decoupled from the implicit differentiation mechanism. We show that seemingly simple principles allow to recover many existing implicit differentiation methods and create new ones easily. We demonstrate the ease of formulating and solving bi-level optimization problems using our framework. We also showcase an application to the sensitivity analysis of molecular dynamics.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence has recently experienced remarkable advances, fueled by large models, vast datasets, accelerated hardware, and, last but not least, the transformative power of differentiable programming. This new programming paradigm enables end-to-end differentiation of complex computer programs (including those with control flows and data structures), making gradient-based optimization of program parameters possible. As an emerging paradigm, differentiable programming builds upon several areas of computer science and applied mathematics, including automatic differentiation, graphical models, optimization and statistics. This book presents a comprehensive review of the fundamental concepts useful for differentiable programming. We adopt two main perspectives, that of optimization and that of probability, with clear analogies between the two. Differentiable programming is not merely the differentiation of programs, but also the thoughtful design of programs intended for differentiation. By making programs differentiable, we inherently introduce probability distributions over their execution, providing a means to quantify the uncertainty associated with program outputs.},

  abstract = {Using the notion of conservative gradient, we provide a simple model to estimate the computational costs of the backward and forward modes of algorithmic differentiation for a wide class of nonsmooth programs. The complexity overhead of the backward mode turns out to be independent of the dimension when using programs with locally Lipschitz semi-algebraic or definable elementary functions. This extends considerably the Baur-Strassen's smooth cheap gradient principle. We illustrate our results by establishing fast backpropagation results of conservative gradients through feedforward neural networks with standard activation and loss functions. Nonsmooth backpropagation's cheapness contrasts with concurrent forward approaches, which have, to this day, dimensional-dependent worst case overhead estimates. We provide further results suggesting the superiority of backward propagation of conservative gradients. Indeed, we relate the complexity of computing a large number of directional derivatives to that of matrix multiplication, and we show that finding two subgradients in the Clarke subdifferential of a function is a NP-hard problem.},

We introduce generalized derivatives called conservative fields for which we develop a calculus and provide representation formulas. Functions having a conservative field are called path differentiable: convex, concave, Clarke regular and any semialgebraic Lipschitz continuous functions are path differentiable. Using Whitney stratification techniques for semialgebraic and definable sets, our model provides variational formulas for nonsmooth automatic differentiation oracles, as for instance the famous backpropagation algorithm in deep learning. Our differential model is applied to establish the convergence in values of nonsmooth stochastic gradient methods as they are implemented in practice.},

  abstract = {Acyclic and star coloring problems are specialized vertex coloring problems that arise in the efficient computation of Hessians using automatic differentiation or finite differencing, when both sparsity and symmetry are exploited. We present an algorithmic paradigm for finding heuristic solutions for these two NP-hard problems. The underlying common technique is the exploitation of the structure of two-colored induced subgraphs. For a graph G on n vertices and m edges, the time complexity of our star coloring algorithm is \$O(n{\textbackslash}overline\{d\}\_2)\$, where \${\textbackslash}overline\{d\}\_k\$, a generalization of vertex degree, denotes the average number of distinct paths of length at most k edges starting at a vertex in G. The time complexity of our acyclic coloring algorithm is larger by a multiplicative factor involving the inverse of Ackermann's function. The space complexity of both algorithms is \$O(m)\$. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first practical algorithm for the acyclic coloring problem. For the star coloring problem, our algorithm uses fewer colors and is considerably faster than a previously known \$O(n{\textbackslash}overline\{d\}\_3)\$-time algorithm. Computational results from experiments on various large-size test graphs demonstrate that the algorithms are fast and produce highly effective solutions. The use of these algorithms in Hessian computation is expected to reduce overall runtime drastically.},

This book is concerned with the determination of the first and second derivatives in the context of solving scientific computing problems with an emphasis on optimization and solutions to nonlinear systems. The authors focus on the application rather than the implementation of AD, solve real nonlinear problems with high performance by exploiting the problem structure in the application of AD, and provide many easy to understand applications, examples, and MATLAB templates.},

  abstract = {With the advent of computer languages such as ADA and PASCAL-SC that allow the definition of new data types and the overwriting of operators it has become feasible to implement new algebras on a computer relatively simply. In the field of optimization when the objective function to be minimised F(x), x{$\epsilon$}RN, can easily involve hundreds of arithmetic operations m, the task of deriving its gradient ∇F and Hessian ∇2F can be daunting and involve many man-days of effort. The classical alternative of estimating the value of the derivatives by difference formulae can lead to numerical limitation on the performance of the code and be computationally expensive. In this paper we discuss five new algebras that make both tasks redundant as with each the computer can accurately evaluate ∇F and ∇2F in far less time than the numerical difference formulae would imply. The interface between these algebras and the Truncated Newton Algorithm for unconstrained optimisation is also described.},

However, in the case where the Hessian is dense, this cannot be done and the space requirements to compute the Hessian can become very large. But if the underlying function can be expressed in a structured form, a ``deeper'' sparsity can be exploited to minimize the space requirement. In this thesis, we provide a summary of automatic differentiation (AD) techniques, as applied to Jacobian and Hessian matrix determination, as well as the graph coloring techniques involved in exploiting their sparsity. We then discuss how structure in the underlying function can be used to greatly improve efficiency in gradient/Jacobian computation. We then propose structured methods for Hessian computation that substantially reduce the space required. Finally, we propose a method for Hessian computation where the structure of the function is not provided.},

Other methods can be derived based on the inherent mathematical properties of generalized complex numbers that enable first-derivative information to be carried in the non-real part of the number. These methods are capable of producing effectively exact derivative values. However, when second-derivative information is desired, generalized complex numbers are not sufficient. Higher-dimensional extensions of generalized complex numbers, with multiple non-real parts, can produce accurate second-derivative information provided that multiplication is commutative. One particular number system is developed, termed hyper-dual numbers, which produces exact first- and second-derivative information. The accuracy of these calculations is demonstrated on an unstructured, parallel, unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes solver.},

The underlying algorithm is the well-known forward mode of automatic differentiation implemented via operator overloading on variables of the class fmad. The main distinguishing feature of this MATLAB implementation is the separation of the linear combination of derivative vectors into a separate derivative vector class derivvec. This allows for the straightforward performance optimization of the overall package. Additionally, by internally using a matrix (two-dimensional) representation of arbitrary dimension directional derivatives, we may utilize MATLAB's sparse matrix class to propagate sparse directional derivatives for MATLAB code which uses arbitrary dimension arrays. On several examples, the package is shown to be more efficient than Verma's ADMAT package [Verma 1998a].},

  abstract = {Practical large-scale mathematical programming involves more than just the application of an algorithm to minimize or maximize an objective function. Before any optimizing routine can be invoked, considerable effort must be expended to formulate the underlying model and to generate the requisite computational data structures. AMPL is a new language designed to make these steps easier and less error-prone. AMPL closely resembles the symbolic algebraic notation that many modelers use to describe mathematical programs, yet it is regular and formal enough to be processed by a computer system; it is particularly notable for the generality of its syntax and for the variety of its indexing operations. We have implemented an efficient translator that takes as input a linear AMPL model and associated data, and produces output suitable for standard linear programming optimizers. Both the language and the translator admit straightforward extensions to more general mathematical programs that incorporate nonlinear expressions or discrete variables.},

We describe the basic components and the underlying philosophy of ADMB, with an emphasis on functionality found in no other statistical software. One example of such a feature is the generic implementation of Laplace approximation of high-dimensional integrals for use in latent variable models. We also review the literature in which ADMB has been used, and discuss future development of ADMB as an open source project. Overall, the main advantages of ADMB are flexibility, speed, precision, stability and built-in methods to quantify uncertainty.},

  abstract = {The computation of a sparse Hessian matrix H using automatic differentiation (AD) can be made efficient using the following four-step procedure: (1) Determine the sparsity structure of H, (2) obtain a seed matrix S that defines a column partition of H using a specialized coloring on the adjacency graph of H, (3) compute the compressed Hessian matrix B {$\equiv$} HS, and (4) recover the numerical values of the entries of H from B. The coloring variant used in the second step depends on whether the recovery in the fourth step is direct or indirect: a direct method uses star coloring and an indirect method uses acyclic coloring. In an earlier work, we had designed and implemented effective heuristic algorithms for these two NP-hard coloring problems. Recently, we integrated part of the developed software with the AD tool ADOL-C, which has recently acquired a sparsity detection capability. In this paper, we provide a detailed description and analysis of the recovery algorithms and experimentally demonstrate the efficacy of the coloring techniques in the overall process of computing the Hessian of a given function using ADOL-C as an example of an AD tool. We also present new analytical results on star and acyclic coloring of chordal graphs. The experimental results show that sparsity exploitation via coloring yields enormous savings in runtime and makes the computation of Hessians of very large size feasible. The results also show that evaluating a Hessian via an indirect method is often faster than a direct evaluation. This speedup is achieved without compromising numerical accuracy.},

  abstract = {Graph coloring has been employed since the 1980s to efficiently compute sparse Jacobian and Hessian matrices using either finite differences or automatic differentiation. Several coloring problems occur in this context, depending on whether the matrix is a Jacobian or a Hessian, and on the specifics of the computational techniques employed. We consider eight variant vertex coloring problems here. This article begins with a gentle introduction to the problem of computing a sparse Jacobian, followed by an overview of the historical development of the research area. Then we present a unifying framework for the graph models of the variant matrix estimation problems. The framework is based upon the viewpoint that a partition of a matrix into structurally orthogonal groups of columns corresponds to distance-2 coloring an appropriate graph representation. The unified framework helps integrate earlier work and leads to fresh insights; enables the design of more efficient algorithms for many problems; leads to new algorithms for others; and eases the task of building graph models for new problems. We report computational results on two of the coloring problems to support our claims. Most of the methods for these problems treat a column or a row of a matrix as an atomic entity, and partition the columns or rows (or both). A brief review of methods that do not fit these criteria is provided. We also discuss results in discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science that intersect with the topics considered here.},

  abstract = {The computation of sparse Jacobians is a common subproblem in iterative numerical algorithms. The sparsity structure is not always known a priori and may sometimes change from point to point. The subject of this paper is the automatic detection of the sparsity structure and its exploitation for an eecient computation of Jacobians using automatic diierentiation, graph coloring, and fast solution algorithms for Vandermonde systems. Many numerical algorithms for the solution of optimization problems, nonlinear algebraic systems, or diierential equations require the computation of Jacobians or other derivatives. In virtually all cases the function of interest f : I R n 7 ! I R m is given as an evaluation routine in a computer programming language. Apart from hand-coded derivatives, symbolic diierentiation, and divided diierences, automatic diierentiation (AD) is an eecient way to obtain derivative values. AD uses the execution trace of the evaluation routine to compute derivative values at a given argument point. The computational eeort, which depends on the number of dependent and independent variables, is clearly predictable and often less than the eeort for divided diierences. In addition, automatic diierentiation is exact up to the precision of the underlying subroutine; in other words, the truncation error incurred by divided diierences is avoided. The sparsity structure of the Jacobian J = f 0 (x) of y = f(x) is determined by the dependency relation between the independent variables x and the dependent variables y. The computational eeort of symbolic diierentiation is dominated by the (typically exponential) expression swell, while hand-coded derivatives are error prone, and their generation is time consuming. Automatic diierentiation tools are based on the code of the evaluation routine. Therefore, information about the dependency relation is available. It is a natural idea to ask for this qualitative dependency information before proceeding to the actual evaluation. (We do not intend to explain the theory of automatic diierentiation and its application. One may refer to M. Iri's contribution in 1], L. Rall's introduction in this volume, or 13] for more detailed introductions.) Four facts are essential in our context: (f1) there are two modes of automatic diierentiation, the forward and the reverse modes, both of which have predictable temporal and spatial complexity; (f2) the forward mode can compute linear combinations of columns (Js) of the Jacobian 1 with a complexity that does not depend on m; 1 We can look at these linear combinations as directional derivatives {\dots}},

  abstract = {An implementation of Automatic Sparsity Detection (ASD) as a new source-to-source transformation is presented. Given a code for evaluation of a function, ASD generates code to evaluate the sparsity pattern of the function's Jacobian by operations on bit-vectors. Similar to Automatic Differentiation (AD), there are forward and reverse modes of ASD. As ASD code has significantly fewer required variables than AD, ASD should be operated in pure mode, i.e. without an evaluation of the underlying function included in the ASD code. In a performance comparison of ASD to AD on five small test problems, ASD is about two orders of magnitude faster than AD. Hence, for a particular class of sparse Jacobians, it is efficient to determine first the sparsity patten via ASD. In a subsequent AD step, this allows to reduce the effective dimension for the evaluation of the Jacobian by avoiding the evaluation of zero elements via a selection of seed matrices according to the sparsity pattern.},

  abstract = {FastOpt's new automatic differentiation tool TAF is applied to the two-dimensional Navier--Stokes solver NSC2KE. For a configuration that simulates the Euler flow around an NACA airfoil, TAF has generated the tangent linear and adjoint models as well as the second derivative (Hessian) code. Owing to TAF's capability of generating efficient adjoints of iterative solvers, the derivative code has a high performance: running both the solver and its adjoint requires 3.4 times as long as running the solver only. Further examples of highly efficient tangent linear, adjoint, and Hessian codes for large and complex three-dimensional Fortran 77-90 climate models are listed. These examples suggest that the performance of the NSC2KE adjoint may well be generalised to more complex three-dimensional CFD codes. We also sketch how TAF can improve the adjoint's performance by exploiting self-adjointness, which is a common feature of CFD codes.},

  abstract = {The paper proposes Metropolis adjusted Langevin and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling methods defined on the Riemann manifold to resolve the shortcomings of existing Monte Carlo algorithms when sampling from target densities that may be high dimensional and exhibit strong correlations. The methods provide fully automated adaptation mechanisms that circumvent the costly pilot runs that are required to tune proposal densities for Metropolis--Hastings or indeed Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithms. This allows for highly efficient sampling even in very high dimensions where different scalings may be required for the transient and stationary phases of the Markov chain. The methodology proposed exploits the Riemann geometry of the parameter space of statistical models and thus automatically adapts to the local structure when simulating paths across this manifold, providing highly efficient convergence and exploration of the target density. The performance of these Riemann manifold Monte Carlo methods is rigorously assessed by performing inference on logistic regression models, log-Gaussian Cox point processes, stochastic volatility models and Bayesian estimation of dynamic systems described by non-linear differential equations. Substantial improvements in the time-normalized effective sample size are reported when compared with alternative sampling approaches. MATLAB code that is available from http://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/research/rmhmc allows replication of all the results reported.},

  abstract = {As mathematical computing becomes more democratized in high-level languages, high-performance symbolic-numeric systems are necessary for domain scientists and engineers to get the best performance out of their machine without deep knowledge of code optimization. Naturally, users need different term types either to have different algebraic properties for them, or to use efficient data structures. To this end, we developed Symbolics.jl, an extendable symbolic system which uses dynamic multiple dispatch to change behavior depending on the domain needs. In this work we detail an underlying abstract term interface which allows for speed without sacrificing generality. We show that by formalizing a generic API on actions independent of implementation, we can retroactively add optimized data structures to our system without changing the pre-existing term rewriters. We showcase how this can be used to optimize term construction and give a 113x acceleration on general symbolic transformations. Further, we show that such a generic API allows for complementary term-rewriting implementations. Exploiting this feature, we demonstrate the ability to swap between classical term-rewriting simplifiers and e-graph-based term-rewriting simplifiers. We illustrate how this symbolic system improves numerical computing tasks by showcasing an e-graph ruleset which minimizes the number of CPU cycles during expression evaluation, and demonstrate how it simplifies a real-world reaction-network simulation to halve the runtime. Additionally, we show a reaction-diffusion partial differential equation solver which is able to be automatically converted into symbolic expressions via multiple dispatch tracing, which is subsequently accelerated and parallelized to give a 157x simulation speedup. Together, this presents Symbolics.jl as a next-generation symbolic-numeric computing environment geared towards modeling and simulation.},

However, accurate Jacobian and Hessian sparsity patterns cannot be computed numerically, leaving the burden on the user to provide them. As scientific simulations have grown in complexity, the application of differentiable programming for calculating the derivatives of arbitrary programs with respect to parameters has been on the rise, but current methodologies do not automatically detect and make use of sparsity-related accelerations. In this manuscript we develop a method for the accurate and efficient construction of sparsity patterns by transforming an input program into one that computes the sparsity pattern of its Jacobian or Hessian. Our implementation, which we demonstrate on partial differential equations, is a scalable technique for acceleration of automatic differentiation on arbitrarily complex multivariate programs. This demonstrates that dynamic program analysis can be effective in more scenarios than are currently well known in differentiable programming.},

The dependence information needed in this probing process consist of ``Boolean'' Jacobian-vector products and possibly also vector-Jacobian products, which can be evaluated exactly by automatic differentiation or approximated by divided differences. The latter approach yields correct sparsity patterns, provided there is no exact cancellation at the current argument.{\P}Starting from a user specified, or by default initialized, probability distribution the procedure suggests a sequence of probing vectors. The resulting information is then used to update the probabilities that certain elements are nonzero according to Bayes' law. The proposed probing procedure is found to require only O(logn) probing vectors on randomly generated matrices of dimension n, with a fixed number of nonzeros per row or column. This result has been proven for (block-) banded matrices, and for general sparsity pattern finite termination of the probing procedure can be guaranteed.},

  abstract = {It is shown how functions that are defined by evaluation programs involving the absolute value function abs() (besides smooth elementals) can be approximated locally by piecewise-linear models in the style of algorithmic or automatic differentiation (AD). The model can be generated by a minor modification of standard AD tools and it is Lipschitz continuous with respect to the base point at which it is developed. The discrepancy between the original function, which is piecewise differentiable, and the piecewise linear model is of second order in the distance to the base point. Consequently, successive piecewise linearization yields bundle type methods for unconstrained minimization and Newton-type equation solvers. As a third fundamental numerical task we consider the integration of ordinary differential equations, for which we examine generalizations of the midpoint and the trapezoidal rule for the case of Lipschitz continuous right hand sides (RHSs). As a by-product of piecewise linearization, we show how to compute at any base point some generalized Jacobians of the original function, namely those that are conically active as defined by Khan and Barton. This subset of the Clarke Jacobian is never empty, independent of the particular function representation in terms of elementals, and also invariant with respect to linear transformations on domain and range. However, like all generalized derivatives the conically active Jacobians reduce almost everywhere to the singleton formed by the proper Jacobian, which may approximate the original function only in a minuscule neighbourhood. Since the piecewise linearization always reflects kinks in the vicinity, we illustrate how it can be used to approximate generalized Jacobians at nearby points along a user specified preferred direction.},

  abstract = {For a real function, automatic differentiation is such a standard algorithm used to efficiently compute its gradient, that it is integrated in various neural network frameworks. However, despite the recent advances in using complex functions in machine learning and the well-established usefulness of automatic differentiation, the support of automatic differentiation for complex functions is not as well-established and widespread as for real functions. In this work we propose an efficient and seamless scheme to implement automatic differentiation for complex functions, which is a compatible generalization of the current scheme for real functions. This scheme can significantly simplify the implementation of neural networks which use complex numbers.},

We show that our approach scales to large problems and can achieve speedups of two orders of magnitude on CPUs and three orders of magnitude on GPUs, compared to a set of manually optimized CPU baselines. To demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach, we employ it to optimize popular algorithms with applications to physical simulation and interactive mesh deformation.},

Nonlinear expressions are translated to loop-free code, which makes it easy to compute gradients and Jacobians by backward automatic differentiation. The nonlinear expressions may be interpreted or, to gain some evaluation speed at the cost of increased preparation time, converted to Fortran or C. We have extended the interpretive scheme to evaluate Hessian (of Lagrangian) times vector. Detecting partially separable structure (sums of terms, each depending, perhaps after a linear transformation, on only a few variables) is of independent interest, as some solvers exploit this structure. It can be detected automatically by suitable ``tree walks''. Exploiting this structure permits an AD computation of the entire Hessian matrix by accumulating Hessian times vector computations for each term, and can lead to a much faster computation of the Hessian than by computing the whole Hessian times each unit vector.},

At the same time, machine learning models are becoming increasingly sophisticated and exhibit many features often seen in scientific computing, stressing the capabilities of machine learning frameworks. Just as the disciplines of scientific computing and machine learning have shared common underlying infrastructure in the form of numerical linear algebra, we now have the opportunity to further share new computational infrastructure, and thus ideas, in the form of Differentiable Programming. We describe Zygote, a Differentiable Programming system that is able to take gradients of general program structures. We implement this system in the Julia programming language. Our system supports almost all language constructs (control flow, recursion, mutation, etc.) and compiles high-performance code without requiring any user intervention or refactoring to stage computations. This enables an expressive programming model for deep learning, but more importantly, it enables us to incorporate a large ecosystem of libraries in our models in a straightforward way. We discuss our approach to automatic differentiation, including its support for advanced techniques such as mixed-mode, complex and checkpointed differentiation, and present several examples of differentiating programs.},

Manual determination of sparsity structure of Jacobian matrix for a large problem is complicated and highly error-prone. The main motivation of this research is to propose an efficient algorithm which can effectively detect and represent sparsity of unknown Jacobian matrices. Automated sparsity detection algorithms find an optimal or near-optimal solution, which reduces time and space complexity for large scale data. Our proposed approach efficiently generates symmetric pattern utilizing band matrix and reduces the number of gradient evaluation. For efficient solution, we integrate our approach with existing pattern detection process. Greedy coloring algorithm is used for column portioning and multilevel algorithm with voting scheme is implemented for detection of sparsity pattern. Finally, parallel computation is used to reduce processing time of the overall approach.},

These NP-complete combinatorial problems arise from problems associated with computing large sparse Jacobian matrices. The main results of this paper lie in approximation analysis related to these problems. In particular, it is shown that (i) both star and acyclic bicoloring can be approximated in polynomial time to the ratio O(n 2/3) and (ii) both star and acyclic bicoloring cannot be approximated to the ratio O(n 1/3-{$\varepsilon$}) in polynomial time under reasonable complexity theoretic hypotheses. The ASBC algorithm is also analysed experimentally on a collection of realistic test cases from the Harwell--Boeing sparse matrix collection. The experimental results indicate that ASBC performs quite well in practice; the performance of the new algorithm always fell within the range of 1.53 and 6 times optimal on the given test sets.},

It is shown here that piecewise differentiable functions are lexicographically smooth in the sense of Nesterov, and that lexicographic derivatives of these functions comprise a particular subset of both the B-subdifferential and the Clarke Jacobian. Several recently developed methods for generalized derivative evaluation of composite piecewise differentiable functions are shown to produce identical results, which are also lexicographic derivatives. A vector forward mode of automatic differentiation (AD) is presented for evaluation of these derivatives, generalizing established methods and combining their computational benefits. This forward AD mode may be applied to any finite composition of known smooth functions, piecewise differentiable functions such as the absolute value function, , and , and certain non-smooth functions which are not piecewise differentiable, such as the Euclidean norm. This forward AD mode may be implemented using operator overloading, does not require storage of a computational graph, and is computationally tractable relative to the cost of a function evaluation. An implementation in C is discussed.},

While the state-of-the-art for evaluating these quantities is almost always based on Lanczos and Arnoldi iterations, the present work is the first to explain how to differentiate these workhorses of numerical linear algebra efficiently. To get there, we derive previously unknown adjoint systems for Lanczos and Arnoldi iterations, implement them in JAX, and show that the resulting code can compete with Diffrax when it comes to differentiating PDEs, GPyTorch for selecting Gaussian process models and beats standard factorisation methods for calibrating Bayesian neural networks. All this is achieved without any problem-specific code optimisation. Find the code at https://github.com/pnkraemer/experiments-lanczos-adjoints and install the library with pip install matfree.},

  abstract = {TMB is an open source R package that enables quick implementation of complex nonlinear random effects (latent variable) models in a manner similar to the established AD Model Builder package (ADMB, http://admb-project.org/; Fournier et al. 2011). In addition, it offers easy access to parallel computations. The user defines the joint likelihood for the data and the random effects as a C++ template function, while all the other operations are done in R; e.g., reading in the data. The package evaluates and maximizes the Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood where the random effects are automatically integrated out. This approximation, and its derivatives, are obtained using automatic differentiation (up to order three) of the joint likelihood. The computations are designed to be fast for problems with many random effects ({$\approx$} 106 ) and parameters ({$\approx$} 103 ).

This limitation poses challenges for problems involving discrete latent variables. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to approximate the gradient of parameters involved in generating discrete latent variables. First, we examine the widely used Straight-Through (ST) heuristic and demonstrate that it works as a first-order approximation of the gradient. Guided by our findings, we propose ReinMax, which achieves second-order accuracy by integrating Heun's method, a second-order numerical method for solving ODEs. ReinMax does not require Hessian or other second-order derivatives, thus having negligible computation overheads. Extensive experimental results on various tasks demonstrate the superiority of ReinMax over the state of the art.},

  abstract = {Derivatives play a critical role in computational statistics, examples being Bayesian inference using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling and the training of neural networks. Automatic differentiation (AD) is a powerful tool to automate the calculation of derivatives and is preferable to more traditional methods, especially when differentiating complex algorithms and mathematical functions. The implementation of AD, however, requires some care to insure efficiency. Modern differentiation packages deploy a broad range of computational techniques to improve applicability, run time, and memory management. Among these techniques are operation overloading, region-based memory, and expression templates. There also exist several mathematical techniques which can yield high performance gains when applied to complex algorithms. For example, semi-analytical derivatives can reduce by orders of magnitude the runtime required to numerically solve and differentiate an algebraic equation. Open and practical problems include the extension of current packages to provide more specialized routines, and finding optimal methods to perform higher-order differentiation.

This paper presents Enzyme, a high-performance automatic differentiation (AD) compiler plugin for the LLVM compiler framework capable of synthesizing gradients of statically analyzable programs expressed in the LLVM intermediate representation (IR). Enzyme synthesizes gradients for programs written in any language whose compiler targets LLVM IR including C, C++, Fortran, Julia, Rust, Swift, MLIR, etc., thereby providing native AD capabilities in these languages. Unlike traditional source-to-source and operator-overloading tools, Enzyme performs AD on optimized IR. On a machine-learning focused benchmark suite including Microsoft's ADBench, AD on optimized IR achieves a geometric mean speedup of 4.2 times over AD on IR before optimization allowing Enzyme to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Packaging Enzyme for PyTorch and TensorFlow provides convenient access to gradients of foreign code with state-of-the-art performance, enabling foreign code to be directly incorporated into existing machine learning workflows.},

Enzyme is a LLVM compiler plugin that performs reverse-mode automatic differentiation (AD) and thus generates high performance gradients of programs in languages including C/C++, Fortran, Julia, and Rust. Prior to this work, Enzyme and other AD tools were not capable of generating gradients of GPU kernels. Our paper presents a combination of novel techniques that make Enzyme the first fully automatic reversemode AD tool to generate gradients of GPU kernels. Since unlike other tools Enzyme performs automatic differentiation within a general-purpose compiler, we are able to introduce several novel GPU and AD-specific optimizations. To show the generality and efficiency of our approach, we compute gradients of five GPU-based HPC applications, executed on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. All benchmarks run within an order of magnitude of the original program's execution time. Without GPU and AD-specific optimizations, gradients of GPU kernels either fail to run from a lack of resources or have infeasible overhead. Finally, we demonstrate that increasing the problem size by either increasing the number of threads or increasing the work per thread, does not substantially impact the overhead from differentiation.},

Automatically generating these derivative computations from an applications source code offers a competitive alternative to other approaches, such as less accurate numerical approximations or labor-intensive analytical implementations. ADIC2 is a source transformation tool for generating code for computing the derivatives (e.g., Jacobian or Hessian) of a function given the C or C++ implementation of that function. Often the Jacobian or Hessian is sparse and presents the opportunity to greatly reduce storage and computational requirements in the automatically generated derivative computation. ColPack is a tool that compresses structurally independent columns of the Jacobian and Hessian matrices through graph coloring approaches. In this paper, we describe the integration of ColPack coloring capabilities into ADIC2, enabling accurate and efficient sparse Jacobian computations. We present performance results for a case study of a simulated moving bed chromatography application. Overall, the computation of the Jacobian by integrating ADIC2 and ColPack is approximately 40\% faster than a comparable implementation that integrates ADOL-C and ColPack when the Jacobian is computed multiple times.},

  abstract = {Developing code for computing the first- and higher-order derivatives of a function by hand can be very time consuming and is prone to errors. Automatic differentiation has proven capable of producing derivative codes with very little effort on the part of the user. Automatic differentiation avoids the truncation errors characteristic of divided difference approximations. However, the derivative code produced by automatic differentiation can be significantly less efficient than one produced by hand. This shortcoming may be overcome by utilizing insight into the high-level structure of a computation. This paper focuses on how to take advantage of the fact that the number of variables passed between subroutines frequently is small compared with the number of variables with respect to which one wishes to differentiate. Such an "interface contraction," coupled with the associativity of the chain rule for differentiation, allows one to apply automatic differentiation in a more judicious fashion, resulting in much more efficient code for the computation of derivatives. A case study involving the ADIFOR (Automatic Differentiation of Fortran) tool and a program for maximizing a logistic-normal likelihood function developed from a problem in nutritional epidemiology is examined, and performance figures are presented.},

Notably, auto\_diff is non-intrusive, i.e., the code to be differentiated does not require auto\_diff-specific alterations. We illustrate auto\_diff on electronic devices, a circuit simulation, and a mechanical system simulation. In our evaluations so far, we found that running simulations with auto\_diff takes less than 4 times as long as simulations with hand-written differentiation code. We believe that auto\_diff, which was written after attempts to use existing automatic differentiation packages on our applications ran into difficulties, caters to an important need within the numerical Python community. We have attempted to write this paper in a tutorial style to make it accessible to those without prior background in automatic differentiation techniques and packages. We have released auto\_diff as open source on GitHub.},

There has been much recent work on normalizing flows, ranging from improving their expressive power to expanding their application. We believe the field has now matured and is in need of a unified perspective. In this review, we attempt to provide such a perspective by describing flows through the lens of probabilistic modeling and inference. We place special emphasis on the fundamental principles of flow design, and discuss foundational topics such as expressive power and computational trade-offs. We also broaden the conceptual framing of flows by relating them to more general probability transformations. Lastly, we summarize the use of flows for tasks such as generative modeling, approximate inference, and supervised learning.},

PyTorch is a machine learning library that shows that these two goals are in fact compatible: it was designed from first principles to support an imperative and Pythonic programming style that supports code as a model, makes debugging easy and is consistent with other popular scientific computing libraries, while remaining efficient and supporting hardware accelerators such as GPUs. In this paper, we detail the principles that drove the implementation of PyTorch and how they are reflected in its architecture. We emphasize that every aspect of PyTorch is a regular Python program under the full control of its user. We also explain how the careful and pragmatic implementation of the key components of its runtime enables them to work together to achieve compelling performance. We demonstrate the efficiency of individual subsystems, as well as the overall speed of PyTorch on several commonly used benchmarks.},

The vertex ordering techniques rely on various notions of ``degree'', are known to be effective in reducing the number of colors used by a greedy coloring algorithm, and are generic enough to be applicable to contexts other than coloring. We employ approximate degree computation in the ordering algorithms and speculation and iteration in the coloring algorithms as our primary tools for breaking sequentiality and achieving effective parallelization. The algorithms have been implemented using OpenMP, and experiments conducted on Intel Nehalem and other multi-core machines using various types of graphs attest that the algorithms provide scalable runtime performance. The number of colors the algorithms use is often close to optimal. The techniques used for computing the ordering and coloring in parallel are applicable to other problems where there is an inherent ordering to the computations that needs to be relaxed for increasing concurrency.},

Since a common use of a large matrix like H is to compute its product with various vectors, we derive a technique that directly calculates Hv, where v is an arbitrary vector. To calculate Hv, we first define a differential operator Rvf(w) = ({$\delta$}/{$\delta$}r)f(w + rv){\textbar}r=0, note that Rv{$\bigtriangledown$}w = Hv and Rvw = v, and then apply Rv{$\cdot$} to the equations used to compute {$\bigtriangledown$}w. The result is an exact and numerically stable procedure for computing Hv, which takes about as much computation, and is about as local, as a gradient evaluation. We then apply the technique to a one pass gradient calculation algorithm (backpropagation), a relaxation gradient calculation algorithm (recurrent backpropagation), and two stochastic gradient calculation algorithms (Boltzmann machines and weight perturbation). Finally, we show that this technique can be used at the heart of many iterative techniques for computing various properties of H, obviating any need to calculate the full Hessian.},

We propose an alternative data structure for sparse Hessians to avoid the use of hash tables and analyse the space and time complexity of EP method. In our benchmarks, we find that EP is very competitive in terms of both preprocessing time and Hessian evaluation time. We identify cases where EP closes the performance gap between JuMP's previous implementation and the implementation in AMPL, a commercial software package with similar functionality.},

If the Hessian matrix is large and sparse, then estimation by finite differences can be quite attractive since several schemes allow for estimation in much fewer than n gradient evaluations.The purpose of this paper is to analyze, from a combinatorial point of view, a class of methods known as substitution methods. We present a concise characterization of such methods in graph-theoretic terms. Using this characterization, we develop a complexity analysis of the general problem and derive a roundoff error bound on the Hessian approximation. Moreover, the graph model immediately reveals procedures to effect the substitution process optimally (i.e. using fewest possible substitutions given the differencing directions) in space proportional to the number of nonzeros in the Hessian matrix.},

Unlike recently developed AD tools in other popular high-level languages such as Python and MATLAB, ForwardDiff takes advantage of just-in-time (JIT) compilation to transparently recompile AD-unaware user code, enabling efficient support for higher-order differentiation and differentiation using custom number types (including complex numbers). For gradient and Jacobian calculations, ForwardDiff provides a variant of vector-forward mode that avoids expensive heap allocation and makes better use of memory bandwidth than traditional vector mode. In our numerical experiments, we demonstrate that for nontrivially large dimensions, ForwardDiff's gradient computations can be faster than a reverse-mode implementation from the Python-based autograd package. We also illustrate how ForwardDiff is used effectively within JuMP, a modeling language for optimization. According to our usage statistics, 41 unique repositories on GitHub depend on ForwardDiff, with users from diverse fields such as astronomy, optimization, finite element analysis, and statistics.

  publisher = {Springer New York},
  abstract = {Monte Carlo statistical methods, particularly those based on Markov chains, are now an essential component of the standard set of techniques used by statisticians. This new edition has been revised towards a coherent and flowing coverage of these simulation techniques, with incorporation of the most recent developments in the field. In particular, the introductory coverage of random variable generation has been totally revised, with many concepts being unified through a fundamental theorem of simulation  There are five completely new chapters that cover Monte Carlo control, reversible jump, slice sampling, sequential Monte Carlo, and perfect sampling. There is a more in-depth coverage of Gibbs sampling, which is now contained in three consecutive chapters. The development of Gibbs sampling starts with slice sampling and its connection with the fundamental theorem of simulation, and builds up to two-stage Gibbs sampling and its theoretical properties. A third chapter covers the multi-stage Gibbs sampler and its variety of applications. Lastly, chapters from the previous edition have been revised towards easier access, with the examples getting more detailed coverage.  This textbook is intended for a second year graduate course, but will also be useful to someone who either wants to apply simulation techniques for the resolution of practical problems or wishes to grasp the fundamental principles behind those methods. The authors do not assume familiarity with Monte Carlo techniques (such as random variable generation), with computer programming, or with any Markov chain theory (the necessary concepts are developed in Chapter 6). A solutions manual, which covers approximately 40\% of the problems, is available for instructors who require the book for a course.  Christian P.

The use of a variational method to perform data assimilation requires the computation of the gradient of a cost function represented by a large-size fortran program. The usual drawback in the reverse automatic differentiation method is the storage requirement. The Odyss{\'e}e system allows one to implement storage/recomputation strategies in order to fit the needed compromizes.

This means informed selection of an AD system and combinations can be a problem-specific variable that can greatly impact performance. In the Julia programming language, the major AD systems target the same input and thus in theory can compose. Hitherto, switching between AD packages in the Julia Language required end-users to familiarize themselves with the user-facing API of the respective packages. Furthermore, implementing a new, usable AD package required AD package developers to write boilerplate code to define convenience API functions for end-users. As a response to these issues, we present AbstractDifferentiation.jl for the automatized generation of an extensive, unified, user-facing API for any AD package. By splitting the complexity between AD users and AD developers, AD package developers only need to implement one or two primitive definitions to support various utilities for AD users like Jacobians, Hessians and lazy product operators from native primitives such as pullbacks or pushforwards, thus removing tedious -- but so far inevitable -- boilerplate code, and enabling the easy switching and composing between AD implementations for end-users.},

In this work, we show that if the family is definable in an o-minimal structure (for instance semialgebraic, subanalytic, or any composition of the previous with exp, log), then the gradient's limit is a conservative set-valued field in the sense introduced by Bolte and Pauwels. Immediate implications of this result on convergence guarantees of smoothing methods are discussed. Finally, a more general result is established, where the functions in the original family might be merely Lipschitz continuous, vector-valued and the gradients are replaced by their Clarke's Jacobians or an arbitrary definable conservative mapping.},

  abstract = {Non-linear optimization is essential to many areas of geometry processing research. However, when experimenting with different problem formulations or when prototyping new algorithms, a major practical obstacle is the need to figure out derivatives of objective functions, especially when second-order derivatives are required. Deriving and manually implementing gradients and Hessians is both time-consuming and error-prone. Automatic differentiation techniques address this problem, but can introduce a diverse set of obstacles themselves, e.g. limiting the set of supported language features, imposing restrictions on a program's control flow, incurring a significant run time overhead, or making it hard to exploit sparsity patterns common in geometry processing. We show that for many geometric problems, in particular on meshes, the simplest form of forward-mode automatic differentiation is not only the most flexible, but also actually the most efficient choice. We introduce TinyAD: a lightweight C++ library that automatically computes gradients and Hessians, in particular of sparse problems, by differentiating small (tiny) sub-problems. Its simplicity enables easy integration; no restrictions on, e.g., looping and branching are imposed. TinyAD provides the basic ingredients to quickly implement first and second order Newton-style solvers, allowing for flexible adjustment of both problem formulations and solver details. By showcasing compact implementations of methods from parametrization, deformation, and direction field design, we demonstrate how TinyAD lowers the barrier to exploring non-linear optimization techniques. This enables not only fast prototyping of new research ideas, but also improves replicability of existing algorithms in geometry processing. TinyAD is available to the community as an open source library.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a framework for solving alternating current optimal power flow (ACOPF) problems using graphics processing units (GPUs). While GPUs have demonstrated remarkable performance in various computing domains, their application in ACOPF has been limited due to challenges associated with porting sparse automatic differentiation (AD) and sparse linear solver routines to GPUs. We address these issues with two key strategies. First, we utilize a single-instruction, multiple-data abstraction of nonlinear programs. This approach enables the specification of model equations while preserving their parallelizable structure and, in turn, facilitates the parallel AD implementation. Second, we employ a condensed-space interior-point method (IPM) with an inequality relaxation. This technique involves condensing the Karush--Kuhn--Tucker (KKT) system into a positive definite system. This strategy offers the key advantage of being able to factorize the KKT matrix without numerical pivoting, which has hampered the parallelization of the IPM algorithm. By combining these strategies, we can perform the majority of operations on GPUs while keeping the data residing in the device memory only. Comprehensive numerical benchmark results showcase the advantage of our approach. Remarkably, our implementations -- MadNLP.jl and ExaModels.jl -- running on NVIDIA GPUs achieve an order of magnitude speedup compared with state-of-the-art tools running on contemporary CPUs.},

  abstract = {Algorithmic differentiation (AD) allows exact computation of derivatives given only an implementation of an objective function. Although many AD tools are available, a proper and efficient implementation of AD methods is not straightforward. The existing tools are often too different to allow for a general test suite. In this paper, we compare fifteen ways of computing derivatives including eleven automatic differentiation tools implementing various methods and written in various languages (C++, F\#, MATLAB, Julia and Python), two symbolic differentiation tools, finite differences, and hand-derived computation. We look at three objective functions from computer vision and machine learning. These objectives are for the most part simple, in the sense that no iterative loops are involved, and conditional statements are encapsulated in functions such as \{{\textbackslash}tt abs\} or \{{\textbackslash}tt logsumexp\}. However, it is important for the success of algorithmic differentiation that such `simple' objective functions are handled efficiently, as so many problems in computer vision and machine learning are of this form. Of course, our results depend on programmer skill, and familiarity with the tools. However, we contend that this paper presents an important datapoint: a skilled programmer devoting roughly a week to each tool produced the timings we present. We have made our implementations available as open source to allow the community to replicate and update these benchmarks.},

Our implementation and the well-known ADOL-C tool (which utilizes taping and compression techniques) are used to compute Jacobian matrices of two nonlinear systems of equations from the MINPACK-2 test problem collection. Timings of the computations are presented and discussed. Moreover, we perform the shape sensitivity analysis of a time-harmonic Maxwell equation solver using our implementation and the tapeless mode of ADOL-C, which implements the dense forward mode AD. It is shown that the use of the sparse forward mode can save computation time even though the total number of independent variables in this example is quite small. Finally, numerical solution of an electromagnetic shape optimization problem is presented.},

It not only provides a thorough background for anyone wishing to use a probabilistic programming system, but also introduces the techniques needed to design and build these systems. It is aimed at people who have an undergraduate-level understanding of either or, ideally, both probabilistic machine learning and programming languages. We start with a discussion of model-based reasoning and explain why conditioning is a foundational computation central to the fields of probabilistic machine learning and artificial intelligence. We then introduce a first-order probabilistic programming language (PPL) whose programs correspond to graphical models with a known, finite, set of random variables. In the context of this PPL we introduce fundamental inference algorithms and describe how they can be implemented. We then turn to higher-order probabilistic programming languages. Programs in such languages can define models with dynamic computation graphs, which may not instantiate the same set of random variables in each execution. Inference requires methods that generate samples by repeatedly evaluating the program. Foundational algorithms for this kind of language are discussed in the context of an interface between program executions and an inference controller. Finally we consider the intersection of probabilistic and differentiable programming. We begin with a discussion of automatic differentiation, and how it can be used to implement efficient inference methods based on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. We then discuss gradient-based maximum likelihood estimation in programs that are parameterized using neural networks, how to amortize inference using by learning neural approximations to the program posterior, and how language features impact the design of deep probabilistic programming systems.},

Here we give a new, simpler derivation for the EP algorithm based on the notion of live variables from data-flow analysis in compiler theory and redesign the algorithm with close attention to general applicability and performance. We call this algorithm Livarh and develop an extension of Livarh that incorporates preaccumulation to further reduce execution time---the resulting algorithm is called Livarhacc. We engineer robust implementations for both algorithms Livarh and Livarhacc within ADOL-C, a widely-used operator overloading based AD software tool. Rigorous complexity analyses for the algorithms are provided, and the performance of the algorithms is evaluated using a mesh optimization application and several kinds of synthetic functions as testbeds. The results show that the new algorithms outperform state-of-the-art sparse methods (based on sparsity pattern detection, coloring, compressed matrix evaluation, and recovery) in some cases by orders of magnitude. We have made our implementation available online as open-source software and it will be included in a future release of ADOL-C.},

  abstract = {We prove the equivalence of two different Hessian evaluation algorithms in AD. The first is the Edge Pushing algorithm of Gower and Mello, which may be viewed as a second order Reverse mode algorithm for computing the Hessian. In earlier work, we have derived the Edge Pushing algorithm by exploiting a Reverse mode invariant based on the concept of live variables in compiler theory. The second algorithm is based on eliminating vertices in a computational graph of the gradient, in which intermediate variables are successively eliminated from the graph, and the weights of the edges are updated suitably. We prove that if the vertices are eliminated in a reverse topological order while preserving symmetry in the computational graph of the gradient, then the Vertex Elimination algorithm and the Edge Pushing algorithm perform identical computations. In this sense, the two algorithms are equivalent. This insight that unifies two seemingly disparate approaches to Hessian computations could lead to improved algorithms and implementations for computing Hessians.},

  abstract = {A toolbox called ADiGator is described for algorithmically differentiating mathematical functions in MATLAB. ADiGator performs source transformation via operator overloading using forward mode algorithmic differentiation and produces a file that can be evaluated to obtain the derivative of the original function at a numeric value of the input. A convenient by-product of the file generation is the sparsity pattern of the derivative function. Moreover, because both the input and output to the algorithm are source codes, the algorithm may be applied recursively to generate derivatives of any order. A key component of the algorithm is its ability to statically exploit derivative sparsity at the MATLAB operation level to improve runtime performance. The algorithm is applied to four different classes of example problems and is shown to produce runtime efficient derivative code. Due to the static nature of the approach, the algorithm is well suited and intended for use with problems requiring many repeated derivative computations.},
