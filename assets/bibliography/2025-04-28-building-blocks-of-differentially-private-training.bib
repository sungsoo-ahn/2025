abstractNote={&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We study the problem of subsampling in differential privacy (DP), a question that is the centerpiece behind many successful differentially private machine learning algorithms. Specifically, we provide a tight upper bound on the Renyi Differential Privacy (RDP) [Mironov, 2017] parameters for algorithms that: (1) subsample the dataset, and then (2) apply a randomized mechanism M to the subsample, in terms of the RDP parameters of M and the subsampling probability parameter.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Our results generalize the moments accounting technique, developed by [Abadi et al. 2016] for the Gaussian mechanism, to any subsampled RDP mechanism.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;}, number={2}, journal={Journal of Privacy and Confidentiality}, author={Wang, Yu-Xiang and Balle, Borja and Kasiviswanathan, Shiva}, year={2021}, month={Feb.} }
