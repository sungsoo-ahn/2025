In recent years, diffusion models, a novel category of deep generative models <d-cite key="JiangMLF2021"></d-cite>, have made significant strides in producing high-quality, high-resolution images. Notable examples include GLIDE <d-cite key="nichol2022glidephotorealisticimagegeneration"></d-cite>, DALLE-2 <d-cite key="ramesh2022hierarchicaltextconditionalimagegeneration"></d-cite>, Imagen <d-cite key="saharia2022photorealistictexttoimagediffusionmodels"></d-cite>, and the fully open-source Stable Diffusion <d-cite key="rombach2022highresolutionimagesynthesislatent"></d-cite>. These models are traditionally developed based  on the framework of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) <d-cite key="ho2020denoisingdiffusionprobabilisticmodels"></d-cite>. In this probabilistic framework, the forward diffusion process is modeled as a Gaussian process with Markovian properties. Conversely, the backward denoising process employs neural networks to estimate the conditional distribution at each time step. The neural networks involved in the denoising process are trained to minimize the evidence lower bound (ELBO) <d-cite key="ho2020denoisingdiffusionprobabilisticmodels"></d-cite> <d-cite key="luo2022understandingdiffusionmodelsunified"></d-cite>, akin to the approach used in a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) <d-cite key="Kingma_2019"></d-cite>. 

In this post, we present a deterministic perspective on diffusion models. In this method, neural networks are constructed to function in the opposite way of a deterministic diffusion process that gradually deteriorates images over time. This training allows the neural networks to reconstruct or generate images by reversing the diffusion process without using any knowledge of stochastic process. This method simplifies the derivation of diffusion models, making the process more straightforward and comprehensible. Within this deterministic framework, diffusion models can be fully explained and derived from scratch using only a few straightforward mathematical equations, as shown in this concise, self-contained post. This approach requires only basic mathematical knowledge, eliminating the need for lengthy tutorials filled with hundreds of complex equations involving stochastic processes and probability distributions. <d-cite key="luo2022understandingdiffusionmodelsunified"></d-cite>.

    Figure 1. A deterministic view of diffusion models in the forward diffusion process and the backward denoising transformation 
    (Image adapted from <d-cite key="karagiannakos2022diffusionmodels"></d-cite>).
</div>

In Figure 1, we illustrate a deterministic view of the typical diffusion process in diffusion models.  Starting with any input clean image, denoted as $$ \mathbf{x}_0 $$, the forward process incrementally corrupts the input image for each time step $$ t=1,2,\cdots,T $$. This corruption is achieved by  progressively adding varying levels of Gaussian noises over time as

$$
\mathbf{x}_t = \sqrt{\alpha_t } \mathbf{x}_{t-1} + \sqrt{1- \alpha_t } \,  {\boldsymbol \epsilon}_t \;\;\; \forall t=1, 2, \cdots, T
$$

adhering to a predefined noise schedule: $$ \alpha_1, \alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_T $$, where the noise at each timestep is Gaussian, $$ {\boldsymbol \epsilon}_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{I}) $$.
This process gradually introduces more noise at each step, leading to a sequence of increasingly corrupted versions of the original image: $$ \mathbf{x}_0 \to \mathbf{x}_1 \to \mathbf{x}_2 \to  \cdots \to \mathbf{x}_T $$. When $$ T $$ is large enough, the last image $$ \mathbf{x}_T $$ approaches to a Gaussian noise, i.e. $$ \mathbf{x}_T \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{I}) $$.

Building on the so-called "nice property" outlined in <d-cite key="ho2020denoisingdiffusionprobabilisticmodels"></d-cite> <d-cite key="luo2022understandingdiffusionmodelsunified"></d-cite> <d-cite key="karagiannakos2022diffusionmodels"></d-cite>, the above diffusion process can be implemented much more efficiently. Rather than sampling a unique Gaussian noise at each time step, it is feasible to sample a single Gaussian noise, $$ \boldsymbol{\epsilon} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{I}) $$, and employ the subsequent formula to efficiently generate all the corrupted samples in one go (along the left-to-right red dash arrow in Figure 1):

$$
\begin{align}
\mathbf{x}_t = f(\mathbf{x}_{0}, {\boldsymbol \epsilon}, t) = \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t} \mathbf{x}_{0} + \sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t} \,  {\boldsymbol \epsilon} \;\;\; \forall t=1, 2, \cdots, T   \label{eq-forward-deterministic}
\end{align}
$$

where $$ \bar{\alpha}_t = \prod_{s=1}^t \alpha_s $$ 
and we have $$ \bar{\alpha}_t \to 0 $$ as $$ t \to T $$.

In the diffusion process described in Eq. (\ref{eq-forward-deterministic}), once the noise $$ {\boldsymbol \epsilon} $$ is sampled, it is treated as constant for the whole diffusion process. Consequently, the transformation from the clean image $$ \mathbf{x}_{0} $$ to noisy images $$ \mathbf{x}_{t} $$ at each time step $$ t $$ can be regarded as a deterministic mapping, characterized by the above function $$ \mathbf{x}_t = f(\mathbf{x}_{0}, {\boldsymbol \epsilon}, t) $$. 

As shown in Figure 2, clean images are gradually converted into pure noises in the above deterministic diffusion process as $$ t $$ goes from $$ 0 $$ to $$ T $$.
The method in Eq.(\ref{eq-forward-deterministic}) streamlines the process, making the generation of corrupted samples more straightforward and less computationally demanding.

## **Deterministic Backward Denoising Process**

If the forward diffusion process is treated as deterministic, the corresponding deterministic mappings for the backward denoising process -- transforming any noisy image $$ \mathbf{x}_{t} $$ back to the clean image $$ \mathbf{x}_{0} $$ -- can also be derived.

Here, let's explore the relationship between  $$ \mathbf{x}_{t-1} $$ and $$ \mathbf{x}_t $$ in the above diffusion process. This exploration will help us understand how consecutive stages in the diffusion process are linked by a deterministic function, which is essential for the subsequent deterministic denoising methods. In fact, it is possible to establish this deterministic function connecting two consecutive samples using two different approaches.

**(1)** In the first method, assuming the noise $$ {\boldsymbol \epsilon} $$ is known, we can rearrange eq.(\ref{eq-forward-deterministic})  for the time step, $$ t $$, as follows:

  $$
  \begin{align}
  \mathbf{x}_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t}}
  \big[ \mathbf{x}_t - \sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t}\,   {\boldsymbol \epsilon} \big]    \label{eq-forwar-t}
  \end{align}
  $$

  Furthermore, according to Eq.(\ref{eq-forward-deterministic}), for the previous time step $$ t-1 $$, we have the following:

  $$
  \begin{align}
  \mathbf{x}_{t-1}  = \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_{t-1}} \mathbf{x}_{0} + \sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_{t-1}} \,   {\boldsymbol \epsilon}
  \label{eq-forwar-t-1}
  \end{align}
  $$

  We may substitue Eq.(\ref{eq-forwar-t}) into the above equation to derive the first relationship between any two adjacent samples as follows:

  $$
  \begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}
  \mathbf{x}_{t-1}  &= \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_{t-1}} \mathbf{x}_{0} + \sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_{t-1}} \,   {\boldsymbol \epsilon} \\
  &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{\alpha_t}} \big[ \mathbf{x}_t - \sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t}\,   {\boldsymbol \epsilon} \big] + \sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_{t-1}} \,   {\boldsymbol \epsilon} \\
  &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{\alpha_t}} \Big[ \mathbf{x}_t - 
  \big( \sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_t} - \sqrt{\alpha_t-\bar{\alpha}_t}
  \big) {\boldsymbol \epsilon} \Big] 
  \end{aligned}   \label{eq-consecutive-time-noise}
  \end{align}
  $$

**(2)** Alternatively, assuming the original clean image $$ \mathbf{x}_{0} $$ is known, we can rearrange Eq.(\ref{eq-forward-deterministic}) as follows

  $$
  {\boldsymbol \epsilon} 
  = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_{t}}} \big[ \mathbf{x}_t - \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t} \mathbf{x}_{0}\big]
  $$ 

  and substitute 
  $$ {\boldsymbol \epsilon} $$ into Eq.(\ref{eq-forwar-t-1}), we have

  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  \mathbf{x}_{t-1}  &= \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_{t-1}} \mathbf{x}_{0} + \sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_{t-1}} \,   {\boldsymbol \epsilon} \\
  &= \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_{t-1}} \mathbf{x}_{0}  + \frac{\sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_{t-1}}}{\sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_{t}}}
  \big[ \mathbf{x}_t - \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t} \mathbf{x}_{0}\big] \\
  \end{aligned}
  $$

  If we denote 
  
  $$
  \bar{\gamma}_t = \frac{1-\bar{\alpha}_{t-1}}{1-\bar{\alpha}_{t}} 
  $$

  we can simplify the above equation as follows:

  $$
  \begin{align}
  \mathbf{x}_{t-1} = \sqrt{\bar{\gamma}_t} \, \mathbf{x}_t 
  + \big( \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_{t-1}} -  \sqrt{\bar{\gamma}_t  \bar{\alpha}_t} \big) \mathbf{x}_0  \label{eq-consecutive-time-x0}
  \end{align}
  $$

However, in practice, we cannot directly use Eq. (\ref{eq-consecutive-time-noise}) or Eq. (\ref{eq-consecutive-time-x0}) to derive $$ \mathbf{x}_{t-1} $$ from $$ \mathbf{x}_t $$ during the backward denoising process, as neither the noise $$ {\boldsymbol \epsilon} $$ nor the original clean image ​$$ \mathbf{x}_0 $$ is known. The key insight of diffusion models is that neural networks can be trained to approximate the inverse of the deterministic mapping function $$ \mathbf{x}_t = f(\mathbf{x}_{0},\boldsymbol \epsilon, t) $$
in the forward process. By leveraging this inverse mapping, the learned neural networks can help to estimate 
either the noise $$ {\boldsymbol \epsilon} $$ or the original clean image ​$$ \mathbf{x}_0 $$ from a noisy image $$ \mathbf{x}_t $$.
There are two approaches for training neural networks, denoted as $$ {\boldsymbol \theta} $$, to approximate this inverse function:
1. Approximate the inverse mapping from $$ \mathbf{x}_t $$ to the clean image $$ \mathbf{x}_0 $$, i.e. $$ \mathbf{\hat x}_0 = f^{-1}_{\boldsymbol \theta} (\mathbf{x}_t, t) $$, allowing Eq. (\ref{eq-consecutive-time-x0}) to be applied for the backward denoising process. This inverse mapping is  shown as the right-to-left red dash arrow in Figure 1. 

2. Approximate the inverse mapping from $$ \mathbf{x}_t $$  to the noise $$ {\boldsymbol \epsilon} $$, i.e. $$ \hat{\boldsymbol \epsilon} = g^{-1}_{\boldsymbol \theta} (\mathbf{x}_t, t) $$, enabling the use of Eq. (\ref{eq-consecutive-time-noise}) for the backward denoising process.

Next, we will briefly explore these two different types of deterministic diffusion models.

## **The Deterministic Diffusion Models**

In the backward process, starting from a Gaussian noise 

$$
\mathbf{x}_T \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{I})
$$  

we may gradually recover all corrupted images backwards one by one until we obtain the initial clean image: 

$$
\mathbf{x}_T \to \mathbf{x}_{T-1} \to \mathbf{x}_{T-2} \to  \cdots \to \mathbf{x}_1 \to \mathbf{x}_0
$$

Alternatively, at any time step $$ t $$, given the corrupted image 
$$ \mathbf{x}_t $$, we may also directly estimate the original clean image $$ \mathbf{x}_0 $$ based on $$ \mathbf{x}_t $$. If the estimate is good enough, we can terminate the backward denoising process at an earlier stage; Otherwise, 
we further denoise one time step backwards, i.e. deriving $$ \mathbf{x}_{t-1} $$ from $$ \mathbf{x}_t $$.  Based on $$ \mathbf{x}_{t-1} $$, we may derive a better estimate of the clean image $$ \mathbf{x}_0 $$. This denoising process continues until we finally obtain a sufficiently good clean image $$ \mathbf{x}_0 $$. 

In the above backward denoising process, to obtain a slightly cleaner image $$ \mathbf{x}_{t-1} $$ from $$ \mathbf{x}_{t} $$ 
using either Eq. (\ref{eq-consecutive-time-x0}) or Eq. (\ref{eq-consecutive-time-noise}), we have two options for training neural networks to approximate the inverse mapping, as previously discussed.

### **I. Estimating clean image $$ \mathbf{x}_0 $$**

In this case, we construct a deep neural network $$ \boldsymbol \theta $$ to approximate the inverse function of the above diffusion mapping $$ \mathbf{x}_t = f(\mathbf{x}_0, {\boldsymbol \epsilon}, t) $$, denoted as

$$
\mathbf{\hat x}_0 = f^{-1}_{\boldsymbol \theta} (\mathbf{x}_t, t)
$$

which can recover a rough estimate of the clean image $$ \hat{\mathbf{x}}_0 $$ from any $$ \mathbf{x}_t $$ (along the right-to-left red dash arrow in Figure 1).
In this case, the neural network is learned by minimizing the following objective function over all training data in the training set $$ \mathcal{D}$$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
L_1({\boldsymbol \theta}) &= \sum_{\mathbf{x}_0 \in \mathcal{D}} \sum_{t=1}^T \Big( f^{-1}_{\boldsymbol \theta} (\mathbf{x}_t, t) - \mathbf{x}_0\Big)^2 \\
&= \sum_{\mathbf{x}_0 \in \mathcal{D}} \sum_{t=1}^T \Big( f^{-1}_{\boldsymbol \theta} \big(\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t} \mathbf{x}_{0} + \sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t} \,  {\boldsymbol \epsilon}, t \big) - \mathbf{x}_0\Big)^2
\end{aligned}
$$

Once the neural network $$ \boldsymbol \theta $$ has been trained, Eq. (\ref{eq-consecutive-time-x0}) can be used to perform the backward denoising process:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{x}_{t-1} &= 
\sqrt{\bar{\gamma}_t} \, \mathbf{x}_t 
+ \big( \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_{t-1}} -  \sqrt{\bar{\gamma}_t  \bar{\alpha}_t} \big) \hat{\mathbf{x}}_0
\\
&= 
\sqrt{\bar{\gamma}_t} \, \mathbf{x}_t 
+ \big( \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_{t-1}} -  \sqrt{\bar{\gamma}_t  \bar{\alpha}_t} \big)  f^{-1}_{\boldsymbol \theta} (\mathbf{x}_t, t) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

The corresponding sampling process to generate a new image can be described as follows:

* sample a Gaussian noise $$ \mathbf{x}_T \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{I}) $$
* **for** $$ t=T, T-1, \cdots, 1 $$:
  * use the trained neural network $$ {\boldsymbol \theta} $$ to compute 
  
  $$
  \hat{\mathbf{x}}_0 = f^{-1}_{\boldsymbol \theta} (\mathbf{x}_t, t)
  $$

  * **if** $$ \hat{\mathbf{x}}_0 $$ is stable **or** $$ t=1 $$, return $$ \hat{\mathbf{x}}_0 $$
  * **else** denoise one step backward as 

$$
 \mathbf{x}_{t-1} = \sqrt{\bar{\gamma}_t} \, \mathbf{x}_t 
+ \big( \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_{t-1}} -  \sqrt{\bar{\gamma}_t  \bar{\alpha}_t} \big) \hat{\mathbf{x}}_0
$$


In Figure 3, we have shown some sampling results from the MNIST-Fashion dataset through the above sampling algorithm via building neural networks to estimate clean images.

Every two lines represent one sampling example: the first line displays denoising samples at each timestep while the second line shows the estimated clean image at each timestep.
</div>


### **II. Estimating noise $$ {\boldsymbol \epsilon} $$**

In this case, we construct a deep neural network $$ \boldsymbol \theta $$ to approximate the inverse function via estimating the noise $$ {\boldsymbol \epsilon} $$ from a corrupted image $$ \mathbf{x}_t $$ at each time step $$ t $$:

$$
\hat{\boldsymbol \epsilon} = g^{-1}_{\boldsymbol \theta} (\mathbf{x}_t, t)
$$

This neural network is learned by minimizing the following objective function over all training data:

$$
\begin{aligned}
L_2({\boldsymbol \theta}) &= \sum_{\mathbf{x}_0 \in \mathcal{D}} \sum_{t=1}^T \Big( g^{-1}_{\boldsymbol \theta} (\mathbf{x}_t, t) - {\boldsymbol \epsilon}\Big)^2 \\
&= \sum_{\mathbf{x}_0 \in \mathcal{D}} \sum_{t=1}^T \Big( g^{-1}_{\boldsymbol \theta} \big(\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t} \mathbf{x}_{0} + \sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t} \,  {\boldsymbol \epsilon}, t \big) - {\boldsymbol \epsilon}\Big)^2
\end{aligned}
$$

Once the  neural network is learned, we can  use Eq.(\ref{eq-consecutive-time-noise}) to derive an estimate of $$ \mathbf{x}_{t-1} $$ from $$ \mathbf{x}_{t} $$ as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{x}_{t-1} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{\alpha_t}} \Big[ \mathbf{x}_t -  
\big( \sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_t} - \sqrt{\alpha_t-\bar{\alpha}_t} \big)   \hat{\boldsymbol \epsilon} \Big] \\
&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{\alpha_t}} \Big[ \mathbf{x}_t -  
\big( \sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_t} - \sqrt{\alpha_t-\bar{\alpha}_t} \big)   g^{-1}_{\boldsymbol \theta} (\mathbf{x}_t, t) \Big] 
\end{aligned}
$$

Similarly, the corresponding sampling process to generate a new image can be described as follows:

* sample a Gaussian noise $$ \mathbf{x}_T \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{I}) $$

* **for** $$ t=T, T-1, \cdots, 1 $$:
  * use the trained neural network $$ {\boldsymbol \theta} $$ to compute:
  
  $$ 
  \hat{\boldsymbol \epsilon} = g^{-1}_{\boldsymbol \theta} (\mathbf{x}_t, t) 
  $$ 
  
  * estimate clean image as in Eq.(\ref{eq-forwar-t}): 
  
  $$ \hat{\mathbf{x}}_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t}}
  \big[ \mathbf{x}_t - \sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t}\,    
  \hat{\boldsymbol \epsilon}  \big] 
  $$

  * **if** $$ \hat{\mathbf{x}}_0 $$ is stable **or** $$ t=1 $$, return $$ \hat{\mathbf{x}}_0 $$

  * **else** denoise one step backward as 

  $$
  \mathbf{x}_{t-1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\alpha_t}} \Big[ \mathbf{x}_t -  
  \big( \sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_t} - \sqrt{\alpha_t-\bar{\alpha}_t} \big)     \hat{\boldsymbol \epsilon} 
  \Big] 
  $$

In Figure 4, we have shown some sampling results from the MNIST-Fashion dataset via building neural networks to estimate noises through the above sampling algorithm.

## **Final Remarks**

In recent years, diffusion models have become increasingly significant in computer vision, emerging as the dominant models for images and videos across a wide range of real-world applications. However, the traditional approach to understanding diffusion models presents a steep learning curve, as it requires advanced mathematical knowledge in areas such as probability density estimation, stochastic process, and differential equation <d-cite key="ho2020denoisingdiffusionprobabilisticmodels"></d-cite> <d-cite key="luo2022understandingdiffusionmodelsunified"></d-cite>. In this post, we have introduced a new deterministic perspective on diffusion models, enabling us to fully explain and derive them using only a few straightforward mathematical equations.
Moreover, we have found that the two methods presented in this post are essentially equivalent to the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIMs) method discussed in <d-cite key="song2022denoisingdiffusionimplicitmodels"></d-cite>. However, our methods are derived through a much simpler and more intuitive approach compared to the procedure outlined in <d-cite key="song2022denoisingdiffusionimplicitmodels"></d-cite>.
