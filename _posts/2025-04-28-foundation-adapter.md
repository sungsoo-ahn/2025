title: Pre-training of Foundation Adapters for LLM Fine-tuning
description: Adapter-based fine-tuning methods insert small, trainable adapters into frozen pre-trained LLMs, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining performance. Despite their advantages, traditional adapter fine-tuning suffers from training instability due to random weight initialization, which can lead to inconsistent performance across different runs. To address this issue, this blog post introduces pre-trained foundation adapters as a technique for weight initialization, potentially improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the fine-tuning process.

## Introduction

Adapter-based fine-tuning methods have revolutionized the customization of large language models (LLMs) by inserting small, trainable adapters inside block layers of frozen pre-trained LLMs <d-cite key="pmlr-v97-houlsby19a,hu2022lora,hu-etal-2023-llm"></d-cite>. These methods reduce computational and memory costs compared to full fine-tuning by training fewer than 1% of the original parameters while maintaining similar performance. The modular nature of adapters also enables efficient multi-task learning and task composition, allowing organizations to maintain a single base model while deploying multiple specialized adaptations for different downstream tasks or domains. 

The issue here is that random initialization of adapter weights in fine-tuning leads to training instability and inconsistent performance across different runs <d-cite key="dodge2020finetuningpretrainedlanguagemodels"></d-cite>, making it challenging to efficiently and reliably adapt models for downstream tasks <d-cite key="chen-etal-2022-revisiting"></d-cite>. To address this issue, this blog post introduces an approach combining continual pre-training and knowledge distillation for pre-training adapters, which serve as a foundation for weight initialization in adapter-based fine-tuning. This replaces the traditional random initialization, potentially improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the fine-tuning process.


## Pre-training of Foundation Adapters

Given a "frozen" pre-trained LLM $$S$$ with trainable adapters $$A$$ attached to each of its block layers, our research question is: *How can we pre-train the adapters $$A$$*? We may follow a previous approach <d-cite key="gunter2024appleintelligencefoundationlanguage"></d-cite> to perform continual pre-training with $$S$$ to learn $$A$$. However, we further extend the previous approach with classical knowledge distillation <d-cite key="wu2024rethinkingkullbackleiblerdivergenceknowledge,muralidharan2024compactlanguagemodelspruning"></d-cite>. In particular, we introduce a joint training method to pre-train the adapters. The method comprises two key modules: knowledge distillation and continual pre-training, as illustrated in Figure 1.

- Knowledge distillation (KD): A larger, frozen pre-trained LLM is employed as the teacher model to facilitate knowledge distillation, transferring its knowledge to a smaller student model that consists of the frozen $$S$$ augmented with trainable adapters $$A$$. Specifically, the Kullback-Leibler divergence is used to measure the difference between the LM head logits of the teacher and student models, resulting in a corresponding knowledge distillation loss $$\mathcal{L}_{\text{KD}}$$ during training, which guides the student to mimic the teacher’s output distributions.


- Continual pre-training (CPT): We continually pre-train the student model (here, $$S$$ with adapters $$A$$) using a causal language modeling objective. By keeping all the original weights of $$S$$ frozen and updating only the adapters' weights, we efficiently adapt the model to new data without overwriting its existing knowledge. A corresponding cross-entropy loss $$\mathcal{L}_{\text{LM}}$$ is computed based on the LM head logit outputs of the student model during training


- Joint training:  The knowledge distillation and continual pre-training tasks are jointly optimized on a text corpus, with the final objective loss computed as a linear combination of the knowledge distillation loss and the cross-entropy loss: $$\mathcal{L} = \alpha\mathcal{L}_{\text{KD}} + (1 - \alpha)\mathcal{L}_{\text{LM}}$$.

## Experiments

### General setup 

In all experiments, we use Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) <d-cite key="hu2022lora"></d-cite> exclusively as our adapters, applying them across all linear layers in the model architecture. In addition, we set the mixture weight $$\alpha$$ in the final loss equation to 0.5. We employ [Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct) <d-cite key="dubey2024llama3herdmodels"></d-cite> as the teacher model.

In  a preliminary experiment where we perform continual pre-training using the "frozen" [Llama-3.2-1B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B) with LoRA rank 8 on the [QuRatedPajama-260B](https://huggingface.co/datasets/princeton-nlp/QuRatedPajama-260B) dataset <d-cite key="pmlr-v235-wettig24a"></d-cite>, we find that the loss and evaluation scores converge at 5B training tokens. Therefore, we use a subset of 5B tokens from QuRatedPajama-260B as our pre-training data for all pre-training settings. 

### Results

#### Knowledge distillation helps improve performance


{% include figure.html path="assets/img/2025-04-28-foundation-adapter/Ablation.png" class="img-fluid" %}
<div class="caption">
    Table 1. Ablation results. CPT and KD denote continual pre-training and knowledge distillation, respectively. With a LoRA rank of 8, the total number of adapter parameters is 5.64 million.
</div>

To investigate the effectiveness of knowledge distillation, our initial experiments utilize the "frozen" [Llama-3.2-1B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B) model with trainable LoRA of rank 8. We explore two scenarios: one where we only perform CPT (i.e., the loss function is $$\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{LM}}$$), and another where we combine CPT with KD.


Table 1 presents results obtained on 6 key benchmarks using the [Eleuther AI Language Model Evaluation Harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness), including AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC; 25-shot) <d-cite key="allenaiarc"></d-cite>, HellaSwag (10-shot) <d-cite key="zellers-etal-2019-hellaswag"></d-cite>, MMLU (5-shot) <d-cite key="hendrycks2021measuring"></d-cite>, TruthfulQA (0-shot) <d-cite key="lin-etal-2022-truthfulqa"></d-cite>, Winogrande (5-shot) <d-cite key="WinoGrande"></d-cite> and GSM8k (5-shot) <d-cite key="cobbe2021trainingverifierssolvemath"></d-cite>. 

Compared to the baseline model Llama-3.2-1B, applying CPT alone reveals small performance changes in most benchmarks, with an average increase from 40.55 to 40.97. This improvement is primarily due to increases in TruthfulQA (from 37.58 to 39.35) and Winogrande (from 62.43 to 63.69), while the remaining benchmarks exhibit negligible or negative changes. In contrast, the model with both CPT and KD demonstrates a more substantial improvement over applying CPT alone. This is evident in the increased average score of 41.62, driven by improvements in MMLU, TruthfulQA, and particularly GSM8K, which increases from 6.90 to 8.87. These results suggest that combining CPT with KD yields more comprehensive performance improvements across multiple tasks.




#### Effects of different LoRA ranks


{% include figure.html path="assets/img/2025-04-28-foundation-adapter/Ranks2.png" class="img-fluid" %}
<div class="caption">
    Table 2. Experimental results with different LoRA ranks. The total number of adapter parameters is 22.54 million, 45.09 million, and 90.17 million for LoRA ranks of 32, 64, and 128, respectively.
</div>


We study the effects of different LoRA ranks—8, 32, 64, and 128—using the [Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct) model with LoRA adapters, employing both CPT and KD. Table 2 shows the results, revealing improvements of over 1.0 points across all ranks compared to the baseline Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct. The model with a LoRA rank of 64 stands out as the best performer, achieving an average score of 48.95 and excelling in the GSM8K benchmark with a score of 37.91. Notably, the overall average scores—48.50, 48.56, 48.95, and 48.62 for ranks 8, 32, 64, and 128, respectively—show minimal variation, indicating that changes in LoRA rank have little impact on performance differences. Benchmarks such as ARC and Winogrande also exhibit only slight fluctuations, while small improvements in GSM8K from rank 8 to 64 are not significant enough to indicate a clear advantage for any particular rank.


#### Use-case: Summarization

<div class="caption">
    Figure 2. ROUGE-L results for different numbers of training examples. "Random" and "Foundation" indicate that when fine-tuning, the LoRA weights are either randomly initialized or initialized using the pre-trained foundation LoRA rank 64.
</div>

In the last set of experiments, we examine the effectiveness of pre-trained foundation LoRA adapters for downstream task fine-tuning, specifically supervised fine-tuning. We utilize the base LLM [Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct) and employ the [QMSum](https://github.com/Yale-LILY/QMSum) dataset <d-cite key="zhong-etal-2021-qmsum"></d-cite>, focusing on query-specific summarization with 1,095 training examples. We compare two strategies for LoRA-based LLM fine-tuning: (1) Random initialization, where the LoRA weights are randomly initialized, and (2) Foundation initialization, where the LoRA weights are initialized using the pre-trained foundation LoRA rank 64 from previous experiments exploring the "effects of different LoRA ranks."

Figure 2 presents the ROUGE-L results when fine-tuning with varying numbers of training examples. When the number of training examples is 0, the score reflects the baseline model's performance with zero-shot prompting. Clearly, fine-tuning significantly improves the summarization score, even with just over 100 training examples. Notably, using pre-trained LoRA weights for initialization consistently outperforms the random initialization across all training sizes, clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of foundation initialization from pre-trained LoRA for this specific use case.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we present a joint training approach that combines continual pre-training and knowledge distillation to pre-train foundation adapters for adapter weight initialization in LLM fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves performance improvements across multiple tasks. Additionally, we show that for a specific use case in summarization, using weight initialization from a pre-trained foundation LoRA enhances performance compared to random initialization. In future work, we plan to evaluate our pre-trained adapters for more downstream tasks. Upon acceptance, we will publicly release our pre-trained LoRA adapters at: [Anonymous URL](https://Anonymous-url).
