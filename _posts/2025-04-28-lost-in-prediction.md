# What is Narrative Economics?

Narrative Economics is the study of how popular stories and ideas (a.k.a **narratives**) formed about the state of the economy could have real effects in the world. In this context, a ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù is a belief about the state of the world that is shared by the population, regardless of the actual state of the economy. For example, a narrative might be the belief that housing prices are increasing, whereas in reality (according to economic indicators) they are stagnating. 

The central idea is that the spread of viral narratives can influence individual and collective economic behavior, leading to fluctuations in markets, changes in investment patterns, and even broader economic shifts.

<div style="width: 70%; margin: 0 auto;"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/2025-04-28-lost-in-prediction/narrative_economics.png" class="img-fluid z-depth-2" %}
    </div></div>
    
<br> 
The term "Narrative Economics" is heavily attributed to Robert J. Shiller, a Nobel laureate economist and the founder of the field, who defined it as:

> *"Spread through the public in the form of popular stories, **ideas can go viral and move markets** ‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs the belief that tech stocks can only go up, that housing prices never fall, or that some firms are too big to fail. Whether true or false, stories like these‚Äîtransmitted by word of mouth, by the news media, and increasingly by social media‚Äî**drive the economy by driving our decisions about how and where to invest, how much to spend and save, and more."***  
  *- Robert J. Shiller* <d-cite key="shiller2017narrative"></d-cite>

## The Ambiguity of the Term "Narrative"

The term "narrative" itself has different connotations in NLP compared to economics, which might lead to some confusion. üòµ‚Äçüí´

**In NLP**, narrative commonly refers to the structure and elements of stories, encompassing aspects like plot, characters, setting, and theme. It involves understanding how these elements interrelate and contribute to the overall meaning and coherence of a narrative.

**In Narrative Economics**, as stated in the above section, narrative is a shared belief or idea that spreads through the population and potentially influences economic behavior. 

**Our research uses the term "narrative" in the economic sense.** We're interested in how shared beliefs about the economy can be used to predict market trends. 

### But, how can we capture such narratives?
The economic term is wide and it is undefined what requirements a story or idea must have in order to be considered as "narrative". Yet, we can look at some characteristics Shiller mentions <d-cite key="coursera_narratives"></d-cite> about narratives to have a better understanding:

* First, the story should be viral, publicly believed, in order to change a large enough audience to move the market.
* Second, Shiller uses some propositions while explaining the term. He states that "the economic impact of narratives may change through time" and "narrative constellations have more impact than any one narrative". 
* Last, Shiller mentions social media as a source of narratives and Google Ngram as a tool for tracking them. 


Combined together, to capture a narrative, one would need a good measure of what many people are discussing, over time. Twitter (X), in this case, is an almost ideal source of information for capturing this distribution of opinions. 

### And how to extract the "narrative" aspect from tweets?
Aligning with Shiller‚Äôs arguments and with existing literature, the extraction might be (for example) a sentiment <d-cite key="macaulay2023narrative, yang2023multi, adams2023more, kim2023forecasting, gurgul2023forecasting, wang2023deepemotionnet"></d-cite>, a topic <d-cite key="ash2021relatio"></d-cite>, or a specific economic outlook <d-cite key="nyman2021news, ahrens2021extracting, handlan2020text"></d-cite>.


## Social Media Narratives ùïè

We have collected two comprehensive datasets of tweets from Twitter (X), a platform chosen for its real-time reflection of public opinions and ability to capture diverse economic narratives. These datasets cover a broad time-frame, and a wide range of topics relevant to the economy, including economics, business, politics, and current events, ensuring a broad and comprehensive representation of narratives.  

Both datasets were carefully curated using targeted queries with the inclusion of specific keywords, and were analyzed to ensure quality and relevant for capturing economic narratives. 

**Pre-Pandemic Twitter Dataset:** Utilizing Twitter API <d-cite key="Twitter-API"></d-cite>, we collected 2.4 million tweets from Twitter's early days (January 2007) to COVID-19 pandemic (December 2020). To prioritize viral tweets, we retrieved the daily top 200 tweets based on follower count,  then we randomly sampled 100 to mitigate potential bias towards highly active accounts typically associated with news outlets. This process yielded a dataset contributed by about 250,000 users per collected topic, each boasting an average follower count of 100 million, including global leaders, news outlets and other influencers.

**Post-2021 Twitter Dataset:** We wanted to test the predictive power of our employed LLM (OpenAI's Chat Completion API with GPT-3.5 <d-cite key="ChatGPT-3.5"></d-cite>) on a timeframe beyond the LLM's data cutoff date (September 2021). Therefore, we collected a second dataset ranging from September 2021 until July 2023. This assures the LLM relies solely on provided tweets and pre-existing knowledge, unaware of 'future' knowledge. Here we collected the tweets monthly, using Twitter Advanced Search, restricting the search to users with at least 1,000 followers. Overall we curated 2,881 tweets <d-footnote>As this data collection method is more restricted than the previous, the resulting dataset is relatively smaller.</d-footnote>, contributed by 1,255 users, including politicians, CEOs, activists, and academics. 

An example tweet can be:

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  {% twitter https://x.com/CNLiberalism/status/1525672295775223808 %}
</div>

This tweet from influential user @CNLiberalism exemplifies the economic narratives captured in our dataset. Posted in May 2022, it captures real-time public concerns about inflation and its impact on the deficit. This type of narrative can influence consumer behavior and market trends, which is central to our research.

### Does Our Dataset Contain Narratives?
To confirm the presence of narratives within our Twitter dataset, we conducted an analysis using RELATIO <d-cite key="ash2021relatio"></d-cite>, a tool designed to "capture political and economic narratives" by mapping relationships and interactions among entities within a corpus. Upon processing our dataset with RELATIO, we obtained "narrative statements" (as defined in their paper) and visualized their temporal distribution:

<div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/2025-04-28-lost-in-prediction/relatio_plot.png" class="img-fluid z-depth-2" style="width: 40%;" %}
    </div>

We can see the evolving nature of these narratives over time, where the distribution is aligned with real-life related events. üëç

### LLMs Show Potential in Understanding Narratives
A more advanced technique to extract and analyze narratives is using LLMs. Prompting OpenAI's Chat Completion API, GPT-3.5 <d-cite key="ChatGPT-3.5"></d-cite> with monthly tweets and prices of economic indicator from matching dates, we generated LLM-based narratives analysis, one for each date in the post-2021 dataset, containing a component of summarized analysis of the tweets and a component of potential effect on the given financial indicator. 

Here's a snippet of such an LLM-based narrative analysis for inputs of dates 29/08/2022 to 28/09/2022. In this time period, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates in an effort to combat inflation and the US Supreme Court ruled that the Biden administration could not extend the pause on student loan payments:

<div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/2025-04-28-lost-in-prediction/chatgpt_snippet.jpg" class="img-fluid z-depth-2" style="width: 50%;" %}
    </div>

This snippet demonstrates the LLM‚Äôs ability to aggregate information, condensing and distinguishing between opinions and occurrences conveyed in the tweets. Moreover, the LLM links its insights to potential future consequences for the financial indicator, a pivotal initial move towards prediction. üëç

# Narrative Economics at the Macro Level

Now that we are familiar with Narrative Economics and have established how we gathered these narratives from Twitter, let's explore why we chose to focus on *macroeconomics*:  

**Macro**ceconomics studies the behavior of the economy as a whole, examining factors like inflation, unemployment, and economic growth. **Micro**economics, on the other hand, is concerned with the decision-making of individuals and firms, examining indicators like a certain stock.

### Why Macroeconomics?
A core concept in Narrative Economics is that narratives can drive economics fluctuations. This is especially intriguing at the macroeconomic level, as the theory suggests that widely shared stories can influence the collective decisions of millions of individuals. Additionally, existing research focuses on microeconomic indicators within the context of Narrative Economics <d-cite key="yang2023multi, khedr2021cryptocurrency, he2021multi, gurgul2023forecasting, wang2023deepemotionnet"></d-cite>, while the application in macroeconomics remains relatively unexplored.

However, studying this at the macroeconomic level is more complex than at the microeconomic level due to the complex interplay of various factors, the need for broadly covering narratives, and the inherent difficulty in isolating causal relationships. 

### Our Macroeconomic Indicators

We focus on predicting three key macroeconomic indicators:

**Federal Funds Rate (FFR):** The interest rate at which depository institutions, such as banks, lend reserve balances overnight to meet reserve requirements. The FFR serves as a Federal Reserve monetary policy tool, is influenced by public perception of economic stability, and its fluctuations impact various sectors, making it widely monitored.

**S&P 500:** A stock market index measuring the performance of the 500 largest publicly traded companies in the U.S. It reflects collective investor confidence in economic growth and risk appetite and is widely regarded as a barometer of the overall health of the US stock market. 

**CBOE Volatility Index (VIX):** Measures market expectations of future volatility based on S&P 500 options prices, often referred to as the 'fear gauge' as it tends to rise during market stress and fall during market stability.

These indicators are well-suited for testing the predictive power of narratives in macroeconomics due to their daily frequency, which aligns with the rapid pace of Twitter, and their sensitivity to public sentiment and behavior.

*** 

# Connecting the Dots: Testing the Effectiveness of Narratives for Macroeconomic Forecasting

The previous two sections discussed the theory of Narrative Economics and our curated Twitter dataset, which holds narratives within them, and the distinction between macroeconomics and microeconomics, explaining why it is interesting to research the theory at the macroeconomic level and which macroeconomic indicators we chose.

We can now delve into the series of experiments we tested to assess the central question - **can economic narratives provide valuable insights for future macroeconomic movements?**

Each experiment tests the predictive power of narratives from the curated datasets, for macroeconomic prediction of one (or more) of the financial targets introduced before: FFR, S&P 500, and VIX. 

We won't be able to cover all the details of the experiments in this blog, but it is available in our paper <d-footnote>Link will be added upon acceptance.</d-footnote>. 

## Experimental Setup

### Prediction Tasks

We test the predictive power of narratives on three tasks commonly used in macroeconomic literature <d-cite key="handlan2020text, 10.1257/jel.20181020, kalamara2022making, ahrens2021extracting, masciandaro2021monetary, lee2009federal, hamilton2002model, kim2023forecasting, larkin2008good"></d-cite>:
* **Next value:** Predicts the target‚Äôs value at the specified horizon.
* **Percentage change:** Predicts the target‚Äôs percentage change between the specified horizon and
the day before.
* **Direction change:** Classifies the target‚Äôs direction of change (increase or decrease) between the
specified horizon and the day before.


### Models Categories

We divide our models into 3 categories based on their input signal:
* **Financial (F):** Utilizes historical financial data, from the past week or month.
* **Textual (T):** Leverages solely textual data, either raw tweets or tweets‚Äô analyses.
* **Textual & Financial (TF):** Draws upon both textual and financial data as input.

Our goal is to effectively leverage insights from both textual narratives and historical financial patterns to improve prediction accuracy.  The added value of incorporating textual narratives can be demonstrated if a model that utilizes both text and financial data (TF model) outperforms a model that relies solely on financial data (F model). 

### Baselines

**Financial baselines:**
* **As/Inverse-previous:** Next value is the same/inverse as previous.
* **Majority:** Next value is the majority vote of the previous week/training data.
* **Up/Down:** Always predict 'increase'/'decrease'.

<br> 

**Counterfactual textual baselines:**

During our experiments, we encountered some intriguing results that warranted further investigation. To ensure the validity of our findings and rule out any counterfactual explanations, we introduced counterfactual textual baselines. These baselines allowed us to rigorously test whether the observed improvements were truly due to the models' capabilities or stemmed from other factors. Unfortunately, these baselines revealed that the promising results were more elusive than we hoped.

* **Random texts:** Feeding the LLM with randomly generated sentences comprised of varying random words. This baseline evaluates whether the LLM actually utilizes the content of tweets.
* **Shuffled tweets:** Feeding the LLM with chronologically disordered tweets, isolating the impact of temporal narratives from confounding patterns or memorization. This baseline assesses the model reliance on temporal narratives.
* **Synthetic 'narratives':** Feeding the LLM with generated narrative-like sentences expressing positive or negative cues, aligned with subsequent changes in the financial target. This baseline assesses the LLM's ability to infer relationships between aligned narratives and the following market changes.

### Models

Our model selection progresses from simpler models, frequently employed in the financial literature <d-cite key="arthur1995complexity, andersen1999forecasting, 10.1257/0895330041371321, hamilton2002model, athey2019machine, kalamara2022making, 10.1257/jel.20181020, masciandaro2021monetary"></d-cite>, to more advanced architectures. This progression serves two purposes: 
1. Achieving positive results with simpler models provides a stronger evidence for the predictive signal of narratives.
2. It allows us to build upon existing research in Narrative Economics, which is primarily rooted in finance and often utilizes relatively simple models, before exploring more advanced NLP approaches.

<br>

**Financial models:** These include traditional ML models (e.g., Linear Regression, SVM), DA-RNN <d-cite key="qin2017dual"></d-cite>, and T5 <d-cite key="raffel2020exploring"></d-cite> which receives financial data input in a text format. Each model is fed with a sequence of historical financial values of the target indicator, either as individual features per day or as a time-series.  

<br>

**Textual models:**
* **Daily sentiment:** A simple method, commonly used in the literature, is presenting each tweet with its sentiment score. Then, we average the scores of individual tweets of the same dates to receive a daily sentiment, and concatenate over a week.
<div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/2025-04-28-lost-in-prediction/models_diagram_1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" style="width: 40%;" %}
    </div>
    
* **LLM's representations of individual/joint tweets:** We derive embeddings of individual or concatenated tweets using pre-trained language models (BERT <d-cite key="devlin2018bert"></d-cite>, RoBERTa <d-cite key="liu2019roberta"></d-cite>, and T5 <d-cite key="raffel2020exploring"></d-cite>). In the individual case, tweet embeddings are aggregated daily by averaging or concatenating embeddings of same-date tweets. In the joint case, tweets are concatenated daily to create a single daily embedding, potentially capturing their collective meaning without explicit aggregation, avoiding potential information loss.
<div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/2025-04-28-lost-in-prediction/models_diagram_2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" style="width: 40%;" %}
    </div>
  
* **LLM-generated analyses for prediction or as input to a subsequent prediction model:** First, we feed OpenAI's Chat Completion API, GPT-3.5 <d-cite key="ChatGPT-3.5"></d-cite> with a month of tweets and corresponding financial values of the target indicator to create monthly analyses.Then, these analyses are either used directly for prediction or as an input to a subsequent T5 model.  
*since the LLM receives both tweets and financial data to enable analyzing relationships, this method applies only for a TF model type.
<div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/2025-04-28-lost-in-prediction/models_diagram_3.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" style="width: 40%;" %}
    </div>

<br>

**Fusing textual and financial models:** We experiment with several strategies for combining the representations from the T and F models for unified prediction:
* **Concatenation:** The simplest approach is concatenating the T and F representations.
* **DA-RNN <d-cite key="qin2017dual"></d-cite>:** The dual-stage attention-based RNN model predicts the current value of a time-series based on its previous values and those of exogenous series. We feed historical financial representations (F) as the time series and
textual representations (T) as the exogenous series.
* **Prompt-based fusion:** LLM-based analysis of given tweets and historical financial values of the target indicator are fed together with raw historical values of the target to a T5 model as separate segments.

  Given a TF model, we can derive a T or F model by omitting or zeroing either F or T component, respectively.



## The Challenges in Improving Models with Narratives

**TL;DR:**
* Models incorporating narratives (TF) show limited improvement over those using solely financial data (F).
* Gains were inconsistent, marginal and statistically insignificant. We regard it as negative results.

### Sentiment-Based Prediction

We fed classic ML models with daily sentiments for FFR 'next value' and 'direction change' prediction (as separate tasks).

**The results:**

* Direction change: üí° <span class="highlight">Adding sentiment data didn't help</span>, as both models with financial input (F & TF) achieved similar accuracy (0.939 vs. 0.936). Additionally, text-only models (T) underperformed (0.89), achieving a comparable accuracy to the F baselines (0.89 vs. 0.81).

| Type | Model | Accuracy |
|---|---|---|
| F baseline | As-previous | 0.812 |
| F | Random Forest Numeric | **0.936** | 
| TF | Random Forest Numeric | **0.939** | 
| T | Logistic Regression | 0.885 |
|---|---|---|
|  | SVM | 0.885 |

<br> 

* Next value: üí° <span class="highlight">None of the models, with or without sentiment or financial data, outperformed the non-learned 'train-mean' baseline</span> (15.4, 15.6).


| **Type** | **Model** | **MSE** |
|---|---|---|
| F baseline | Train-mean | 15.661 |
| F | SVM | 15.416 |
| TF | SVM | 15.416 | 
| T | SVM | 15.36 | 

<br> 

**What can we learn? ü§î** Sentiment analysis lacks the nuance necessary for accurate financial prediction, and traditional ML models have limitations in capturing complex market dynamics. ‚û°Ô∏è We need an improved text representations and more advanced prediction models.  


### Embeddings for Time-Series Prediction

Here we turn to embedding-representations (as explained in the Experimental Setup) and to DA-RNN <d-cite key="qin2017dual"></d-cite> model, which is designed to capture temporal dynamics and complex relationships within its given data.

We extensively evaluated various model configurations, target indicators (FFR and VIX), tasks ('next value', 'percentage change', 'direction change' and the last two together), prediction horizons (next-day, next-week), LLM architectures (see Experimental Setup), aggregation methods, and the daily number of tweets given as input. Additionally, we assessed the models' reliance on temporal context and relevant narratives using the counterfactual textual baselines.

To keep it short, we present results only for predicting the VIX 'next value' of the next-day and next-week (as separate tasks). Additional experiments showed a recurring pattern to the presented results.

**The results:**

<div style="width: 70%; margin: 0 auto;"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/2025-04-28-lost-in-prediction/embeddings_exp_results.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div></div>

* Next-day prediction: üí° <span class="highlight">The non-learned 'as-previous' F baseline outperforms all other models</span> (3.079 MSE). This suggests that the input data may not be beneficial for such a short-term prediction. 

* Next-week prediction: <span class="highlight">Initially both TF models (13.148, 13.147) appeared to outperform the F model (13.463) and F baseline</span> (16.172), implying a potential influence of the textual content. <br> üí° <span class="highlight">However, the 'random texts' TF baseline</span> (13.056), which replaced actual tweets with randomly generated text, <span class="highlight">outperformed all other models</span>, indicating the observed improvement was not driven by meaningful textual content. 

We hypothesize that the presence of text improves performance, even when random, due to spurious correlations or random noise aiding generalization, similar to regularization techniques. A contributing factor may be the difficulty of effectively capturing and representing aggregated tweet information for financial prediction, as well as the inherent challenges in predicting future values of a volatile financial indicator, characterized by frequent random movements and fluctuations, using its historical values.  ¬† 

**What can we learn? ü§î** Our models struggled to leverage tweets for the prediction, indicating that implicitly capturing and aggregating latent narratives within LLMs remains a challenge.

### Predicting Using LLM Analyses

**Can LLMs generate an accurate prediction?** We first tried to directly predict the financial indicator (average weekly VIX or S&P 500) as a generative response of the web chat version of GPT <d-cite key="gpt-chat"></d-cite> prompted with a monthly window of tweets and corresponding values of the financial target. This resulted in limited inconsistent success. üí° <span class="highlight">While the LLM consistently generated insightful narrative analyses and demonstrated comprehension of financial implications, it exhibited inconsistencies when applying these insights for prediction.</span> For instance, it occasionally refused to provide predictions, or it would simply mirror input ranges, neglecting the potential impact of the narratives it successfully analyzed. When presented with 'synthetic narratives', it recognized the change direction but struggled to quantify the magnitude of it.

<br>

**Repurposing the LLM analyses for a subsequent prediction model:** The previous experiment revealed the LLM's ability to generate insightful analyses of tweets and financial data. To leverage this capability, we utilize these analyses as inputs for a dedicated prediction model to predict the S&P 500 'direction change'.

This approach addresses limitations of the two previous experiments by:
* Instead of relying on the embedding-based approach, which struggled to aggregate diverse narratives, we leverage the LLM's ability to produce concise analyses. ¬† 
* Instead of directly using the LLM for prediction, which exhibited inconsistencies, we utilize a separate fine-tuned model for downstream prediction.

  
**The results:**
  
| Type | Model | Accuracy | F<sub>1</sub>-Score|
|---|---|---|---|
|  | Train-majority | 0.424 | 0.0 |  
|---|---|---|---|
|  | Week-majority | 0.484 | 0.598 | 
|---|---|---|---|
| F-baselines | As-previous | 0.484 | 0.552 | 
|---|---|---|---|
|  | Inverse-previous | 0.517 | 0.511 | 
|---|---|---|---|
|  | Up-predictor | 0.576 | 0.731 | 
|---|---|---|---|
|  | Down-predictor | 0.424 | 0.0 |  
| F | T5 Base | **0.604** | 0.723 |  
|---|---|---|---|
|  | T5 Large | 0.593 | **0.727** | 
| TF | T5 Base | 0.626 | 0.738 | 
|---|---|---|---|
|  | T5 Large | **0.627** | **0.742** |  
| T | T5 Large | 0.587 | 0.726 | 
| T-baseline | Synthetic narratives | 0.489 | 0.254 |


**Did it work?** Unfortunately, not really. üí° Results show that <span class="highlight">there is no significant difference between the best TF and F models</span>, with a performance gap of ~2% on the limited test set of ~90 samples. <d-footnote>As a reminder, we can only use the second Twitter dataset, of tweets that were posted after the LLM's training cutoff date, and our financial indicators are of daily frequency, therefore the small dataset for this type of experiments.</d-footnote>
We confirmed it using the McNemar's test <d-cite key="P18-1128"></d-cite>, which showed no statistically significant difference (p-value=0.48).
On the good side, this is the only approach where our models surpassed all baselines. 

**What can we learn? ü§î** While LLMs can analyze narratives, the TF model struggled to effectively leverage this analysis for improved prediction.

# What Can We Take Away?

Despite the presence of narratives in our curated datasets and the development of NLP tools for narrative extraction, evaluating their impact on macroeconomic prediction remains challenging.  Our models incorporating narrative data showed limited improvement over those using only financial data, failing to consistently outperform baselines or financial models.  Any observed improvements were marginal and statistically insignificant and we regard it as a negative result.

The missing link between the successful narrative extraction demonstrated by the LLM's analyses and the limited improvement in macroeconomic prediction **raises a question about the extent to which narratives alone can truly drive and forecast economic fluctuations**, at least at the macroeconomic level.

This study serves as a foundation for further exploration, highlighting the need for new macroeconomic models or tasks that can effectively assess the influence of extracted narratives on the economy.
