title: Is Multi-Agent Debate Better, More Efficient, and More Perferrable than Single-Agent Inference?
description: Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) explores leveraging collaboration among multiple large language model (LLM) agents to improve test-time performance without additional training. Despite its intuitive appeal, MAD's efficiency and effectiveness compared to single-agent methods like Chain-of-Thought (COT) and Self-Consistency (SC) remain unclear.
This blog evaluates five MAD frameworks across nine benchmarks, revealing that current MAD methods fail to consistently outperform simpler single-agent strategies, even with increased computational resources. Analysis of factors such as agent configurations and debate rounds suggests that existing MAD designs fall short in fully utilizing additional inference-time computation. Consequently, MAD may not yet be a reliable approach for enhancing LLM performance. However, there is potential space for further improvement, as MAD may be limited by specific shortcomings, such as the vague information exchange during debates and the insufficient utilization of the diverse LLMs.

## Introduction

An age-old saying, **two heads are better than one**, encapsulates the enduring lesson that collaboration often triumphs over solitary effort. While traditionally rooted in human interactions, this principle has recently found applications in the field of large language models (LLMs).
One emerging line of research, commonly referred to as multi-agent debate or discussion (MAD), explores the potential of engaging multiple LLM agents in structured communications. 
By enabling these agents to iteratively debate or discuss, researchers have shown that, without any additional training, the resulting final outputs can surpass those of a single model. Thus, MAD, attracting growing interest, is recognized as a potential strategy for test-time (or inference-time) computation. 


A typical MAD works as follows: given a question, multiple LLM agents independently generate initial answers in parallel; over several rounds, agents review other agents' answers and incorporate collective feedback to refine their answers; finally, the refined answers are aggregated to form the final answer. 
Besides, agents are often prompted to role-play certain personas, as shown by existing research, to be effective in stimulating critical thinking and divergent feedback.
Moreover, some advanced MAD frameworks incorporate a summarizer agent to dynamically construct the final answer when simple majority voting fails, e.g., on coding tasks. 
Since MAD somewhat mirrors how humans engage in group discussions, it is perhaps unsurprising that MAD can improve the performance of LLMs at test time by utilizing more inference budgets and aggregating diverse information extracted from multiple agents.


However, despite the appealing intuition that deliberative collective thinking can integrate larger inference-time computation to improve the outputs, questions remain regarding its performance w.r.t. efficiency, particularly when compared to single-agent test-time computation strategies. Can MAD obtain a corresponding level of performance improvement with a reasonable extra test-time computational cost? Can MAD gain consistent performance improvements as computational costs increase (in other words, can a stable scaling law be observed)? Can MAD meet our expectations by effectively aggregating the knowledge of different agents to produce more refined answers?

In this blog, we take a systematic review of existing MAD frameworks, with a special focus on their performance and efficiency in comparison to widely used single-agent inference techniques, such as Chain-Of-Thought (COT) and Self Consistency (SC). Our evaluation of 5 typical MAD frameworks on 9 benchmarks  led us to a surprising conclusion---\emph{current MAD frameworks fail to consistently outperform simple single-agent test-time computation strategies}. We further explored the impact of various configurations on MAD performance, including the number of agents, the rounds of debate, and the foundation models used by the agents, in an effort to mitigate the negative effects of suboptimal hyperparameter settings on MAD performance. However, we did not observe MAD effectively leveraging extra test-time computation to improve reasoning outcomes. After these extensive evaluations, we concluded that current MAD frameworks may not be a good choice for enhancing agent performance at inference time. 


## Multi-Agent Debate Formulation
In this section, we take a brief review of existing MAD frameworks and then present a general framework that encapsulates the main ideas of MAD frameworks.

Inspired by **The Society of Mind**, Du et al.<d-cite key="duimproving"></d-cite> presented the first LLM-based MAD framework. In this framework, multiple agents independently generate proposals and collaboratively engage in deliberation on their respective reasoning processes to reach a consensus on a unified response. The answers may be optionally summarized before being added to the history that is available to the agents in future rounds.

**Multi-Persona**<d-cite key="liang2023encouraging"></d-cite> leverages the role-playing capabilities of LLMs to encourage diverse thinking. In this approach, an affirmative agent(angel) and a negative agent(devil) present their answer to a judge agent, which ultimately determines the final solution.

While leveraging multi-persona role-playing, **ChatEval**<d-cite key="chanchateval"></d-cite>  explores communication strategies among agents through three frameworks, focusing on the impact of asynchronous responses and round-by-round summarization on agent performance.

**Exchange-of-Thought** <d-cite key="yin2023exchange"></d-cite> similarly emphasizes the study of communication strategies. It introduces four distinct communication paradigms and undertakes a comprehensive analysis of communication volume and information propagation speed. Additionally, it implements a confidence evaluation mechanism designed to reduce the adverse effects of erroneous reasoning processes.


**AgentVerse** <d-cite key="chen2023agentverse"></d-cite> is a meticulously designed and sophisticated multi-agent collaboration framework, distinct from conventional MAD frameworks. In AgentVerse, an agent will take the role of HR to hire experts to collaboratively draft the solution, allowing dynamic adjustment of group members based on current progress.


Current MAD methods can be represented as a directed graph, where each node corresponds to invoking an LLM agent, and each edge denotes the transfer of outcomes between agents. Specifically, the action performed at each node is defined as follows:

$$a \sim F(G(q,x;h,\bm{\theta},\beta,p))$$

where $h$ denotes the chat history of the agent, $\theta$ denotes parameters of the pre-trained base model, $\beta$ denotes inference hyper-parameters, $p$ denotes formatting prompts guiding the debate, $q$ denotes the input question, and $x$ denotes the answers from other agents (output from input nodes). $G$ represents invoking an LLM agent with specified configurations and $F$ denotes the post-processing of the agent's output. For instance, in EoT, the post-processing function $F$ assigns a confidence score to each agent's output, enabling other agents to assess whether the outcome was generated with high confidence. The final response, $a$, is sampled from the conditional distribution $F(G(\circ; \circ))$. A digraph denoted as $G= (V,E)$ can describe the architecture of the MAD framework. A directed edge $e = (v_i, v_j) \in E$ will transmit an output $a_i$ from node $v_i$ to its subsequent neighbor $v_j$, which gives $a_i \in x_j$. If $(v_i, v_j)$ is the only incoming edge for $v_j$, then $x_j=\{a_i\}$. Additionally, the workflow of MAD frameworks can sometimes be conditional, depending on specific outputs from certain agents. For instance, in AgentVerse, the verifier’s output may determine whether the solver is invoked again to provide a refined solution.

## Evaluation

### Experimental setup

**Datasets** 
We conduct our evaluation on 9 widely adopted benchmarks: MMLU, MMLU-Pro, AGI-Eval, CommenSenseQA, ARC-Challenge, GSM8k, MATH, HumanEval, and MBPP. Note that we intentionally avoid including ``vague'' benchmarks, e.g., machine translation or context extraction, which often rely on unstable metrics (BLEU, ROGUE) to evaluate the tested LLM. To save evaluation expenses, we limit the number of testing samples to 500 if there are more than 500 samples in the testing set.

**Foundation models**
We consider representative close-sourced LLMs GPT-4o-mini, as well as open-sourced LLM Llama3.1, to obtain our main results. We further explore combining different LLMs in a single MAD process to aggregate diverse knowledge resources. Unless stated otherwise, we maintain consistent inference configurations throughout our evaluation, setting the temperature $T=1$ and $top\text{-}p=1$, to balance generation quality and diversity.

**MAD methods and baselines**
We consider five state-of-the-art MAD frameworks in our evaluation: Society-of-Minds (SoM), Multi-Persona (MP), Exchange-of-Thoughts (EoT), AgentVerse, and ChatEval. We further include direct prompting, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and Self-consistency (SC) as baseline inference methods. Unless otherwise mentioned, we adopted default configurations of each evaluated method.

We record experimental results in tables above. We highlight the result with <span style='background-color: #CCFFFF; color: black;'>blue</span> when the evaluated inference method underperform CoT, and <span style='background-color: #FFCCCC; color: black;'>red</span> otherwise. Observe that most MAD frameworks are not able to achieve consistently better performances than CoT, which is a surprising outcome given the larger inference computation required by MAD frameworks. When we compare MAD frameworks to SC, which resamples from the same LLM agent to obtain the most consistent answer, we can observe that most MAD frameworks fail to surpass SC. 

Specifically, we find that Multi-Persona significantly underperforms almost any other baselines. We attribute this to the fact that Multi-Persona explicitly instructs the devil agent to counter whatever the angel agent says. However, once the judge agent determines the devil's side is correct, the angel agent has no opportunity to continue debating. This limitation results in a more pronounced performance drop, particularly when a weaker model, such as Llama 3.1-8b, is used as the base. As a result, Multi-Persona consistently performs the worst among all MAD methods across nearly all datasets. What's more, AgentVerse performs worse using Llama3.1:8b as the foundation model, which can be explained by that AgentVerse has a strict formatting requirement. Once the agent responds in an unexpected way, the debate fails. \hf{footnote about re-execution}

We differentiate hyperparameters in MAD frameworks to assess whether limited performances are due to suboptimal hyperparameter selection. For instance, without an appropriate configuration, MAD may fail to scale effectively. Specifically, we increase the number of agents and the number of debating rounds to allow MAD to leverage greater test-time computation in its search for better responses.

Our empirical results, presented in figures above, reveal that increasing test-time computation does not always improve accuracy. This finding suggests that current MAD frameworks may not effectively utilize larger inference budgets. We note that EOT demonstrates scalability to some extent, but we also observed that under the same conditions, EOT performs worse than other MAD methods.

Note that prompts and response styles in MAD frameworks differ, adjusting the number of rounds and agentsn, therefore, cannot clearly reflect how well MAD frameworks utilize test-time computation. We further compare accuracy concerning consumed tokens in Figure. 2 to learn whether MAD frameworks can scale with increased test-time computation. We find that, only EOT (on GSM8k and MMLU) and MAD (on HumanEval) exhibit scalability. However, these methods are not the optimal one in both scenarios. Interestingly, while we did not observe obvious scalability in single MAD framework, we do find that the accuracy improves as the inference method (including SC) generate more tokens.

</div>

We also conduct a statistical analysis of agents' behavior during the debating process. Specifically, we compare the outcomes of different inference methods to those of a single agent. From this comparison, four scenarios emerge: the inference method produces a consistent answer (correct or incorrect) or transforms a correct/incorrect answer into an incorrect/correct one. Ideally, the ratio of correcting wrong answers should be higher than the ratio of turning correct answers into incorrect ones to improve overall accuracy. Our results are presented in Figure. 3, where a green bar represents the number of corrected answers, and a red bar represents the number of answers erroneously reversed compared to standard single-agent prompting. Shorter red bars and taller green bars denote better performances.

The results show that Self-Consistency effectively minimizes the frequency of errors while correcting a significant number of wrong answers. In contrast, while Multi-Persona and AgentVerse sometimes achieve comparably tall green bars, these methods often fail to preserve correct answers. This suggests that MAD methods can be overly aggressive, lacking the ability to reliably identify incorrect answers. Consequently, MAD methods generally exhibit taller red bars compared to CoT or Self-Consistency.

Finally, we explore whether different foundation models can serve as the key factor to a better performance. We enumerate different combinations of GPT-4o-mini, Llama3.1-70b, and Claude-haiku and compare the performances with merely one foundation model. As observed in the table above, we can achieve better accuracy when combining GPT-4o-mini and Llama3.1-70b together. Even when Llama3.1-70b does not obviously outperform GPT-4o-mini on HumanEval, combining one or two Llama3.1-70b with GPT-4o-mini still significantly improve the performance of MAD framework. In contrast, we also observe that combination does not always has positive influence. Therefore, how to effective combine different foundation models to improve MAD framework may be a valuable future direction. 


### Limitations

In this part, we discuss the limitations of our evaluation design to mitigate concern about whether our evaluation can fairly compare MAD frameworks against other baselines. First, our evaluation of MAD configuration sensitivity is limited to the number of agents, the number of debating rounds, and the different foundation models incorporated. These configurations are paid extra attention during evaluation due to most MAD frameworks provide flexibility in adjusting them. Therefore these configurations are the prior candidates to be changed when the MAD framework is deployed. Due to the heavy expense involved in inferring with LLMs, we limit the scale of our ablation studies to control the total expense. However, in our evaluation, we didn't observe obvious trends in performance concerning more agents or more debating rounds.

Another limitation in our evaluation is the prompt used to invoke LLM agents. We strictly followed the original prompt configuration of considered MAD frameworks with necessary modifications to make the MAD run in an expected way. While we didn't extensively search for an optimal combination of MAD prompts, we made sure that all key ideas and components proposed in existing MAD frameworks were carefully implemented and observed in the debating procedure, e.g., the confidence level of agent in EoT and the expert-hiring stage in AgentVerse. Therefore, our implementation can be considered a qualitative reproduction of existing MAD frameworks.

## Discussion

### We obtain consistent observation with existing research
While the empirical results shown above are surprising that most MAD frameworks cannot even perform better than CoT, we want to clarify that our observation is not contradictory with previous outcomes in MAD research. Specifically, SoM, AgentVerse, and ChatEval were not compared against CoT on these widely used benchmarks. MP was evaluated against CoT only on a handcrafted dataset named Counter-Intuitive Arithmetic Reasoning (CIAR). EoT was compared to CoT on GSM8k only, in which EoT was shown to be slightly better than CoT. We observe the same result in our evaluation. Therefore, our empirical results are consistent with former observations. 


### Potential future directions
Although the previous part of this blog post mostly reflected a negative outcome of current MAD methods, we want to emphasize that this is by no means indicating that MAD is not worth further exploration. Instead, we would argue that the development of MAD methods is still in its early stages, with limited exploration of the deep-level mechanisms behind MAD frameworks. We list several possible future directions in the development of MAD frameworks.

First, most test cases in existing benchmarks only require a single knowledge point to be solved, which naturally makes MAD unnecessary. Under this circumstance, MAD degrades to an inefficient resampling method aggregating responses from agents via natural language communication. Such benchmarks cannot accurately reflect the complex reasoning capability of MAD. Besides, recently proposed MAD frameworks may be optimized to be effective on these benchmarks, which strictly limit the development of MAD methods. 

What's more, current MAD methods are not fine-grained enough. Agents debate based on their full responses to the given query. Consequently, agents overly assign weight to the final answer instead of the reasoning steps. When an agent receives different answers from another agent, it will establish its debating response mostly based on the fact that the other agent answers differently, instead of analyzing the gap between their reasoning and why they obtain different answers. 

We also observe that directly adopting a pre-trained LLM for debating may be sub-optimal. As discussed above, LLM inherently has certain preferences for candidate answers, which may prohibit debaters from accurately selecting the answer fully based on its correctness. In other words, it may not be appropriate to directly deploy pre-trained LLMs in the MAD framework. In context learning or supervised fine-tuning could help pre-trained learn how to debate effectively. 

## Conclusion
In this blog, we review existing MAD frameworks, with a specific focus on the comparison between MAD frameworks and single-agent inference methods. With comprehensive evaluation, we conclude that current MAD frameworks do not consistently outperform baseline methods including Chain-of-Thought and Self-Consistency. Our ablation study showed that MAD cannot scale well with increased inference budget. However, we believe MAD frameworks still have the potential to take effect, given that combining multiple foundations models showed promising performance improvement. We also note that current MAD designs may have some drawbacks limiting the performance, which we list as future directions in our discussion.
