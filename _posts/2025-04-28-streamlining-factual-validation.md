## Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT, have advanced natural language processing by offering incredible fluency and adaptability <d-cite key="brown2020"></d-cite>. Yet, these models are susceptible to **"hallucinations"**---outputs that are linguistically coherent but factually incorrect <d-cite key="ji2022, maynez2020"></d-cite>. This issue arises because LLMs optimize for contextual fluency rather than accuracy, a trade-off that becomes increasingly problematic in applications where precision or reliability is necessary <d-cite key="holtzman2019, esteva2019, ullah2024"></d-cite>.

<figure style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="{{ 'assets/img/2025-04-28-streamlining-factual-validation/hallucination.png' | relative_url }}" style="width: 85%;">

        <strong>Figure 1.</strong> An example of hallucination in ChatGPT. This figure demonstrates a fabricated response confidently generated by ChatGPT, showing how large language models (LLMs) can produce coherent but factually incorrect outputs. The highlighted sections indicate fictional and misleading content, emphasizing the challenges in ensuring factual accuracy in LLM-generated responses.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

Existing solutions, including fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and post-hoc validation, address specific aspects of this problem but often at the cost of scalability or computational efficiency <d-cite key="guu2020"></d-cite>. These methods frequently fail to account for the growing demand to process unstructured data efficiently while maintaining factual accuracy.

In this blog post, we explore an enhancement to RAG pipelines that combines summarization, clustering with DBSCAN, and vectorized fact storage to address challenges in managing unstructured data <d-cite key="ester1996"></d-cite>. By processing expansive datasets into concise, verifiable formats, this approach optimizes storage efficiency while preserving factual accuracy. Evaluated on the PubmedQA dataset, our framework demonstrates how preprocessing can streamline workflows and improve scalability without compromising retrieval precision, offering new possibilities for real-world applications <d-cite key="jin2019"></d-cite>.

## The Challenge of Factual Accuracy in AI

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Hallucinations and Trust Deficit</span>

Hallucinations in LLMs arise from their probabilistic design, which prioritizes predicting plausible sequences over verifying factual accuracy <d-cite key="radford2019"></d-cite>. This limitation is magnified by two interconnected factors:

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">1. Dynamic and Unstructured Contexts</span>

LLMs are trained on vast corpora of text that often lack semantic organization. Moreover, the facts embedded within these datasets are static—reflecting the state of the world at the time of training. However, real-world knowledge evolves dynamically, leaving models unable to adapt without post-training updates <d-cite key="mousavi2024"></d-cite>. 

#### Formalizing the Knowledge Divergence
Let the model's knowledge at time $$t$$ be denoted as $$K(t)$$. We can express the knowledge state as:
$$
K(t) = \textcolor{#5DADEC}{K(t_0)} + \textcolor{#E67E22}{\Delta K(t)},
$$
where:
- $$\textcolor{#5DADEC}{K(t_0)}$$ represents the knowledge at the time of training.
- $$\textcolor{#E67E22}{\Delta K(t)}$$ captures incremental updates post-deployment.

In most deployed LLMs:
$$
\textcolor{#E67E22}{\Delta K(t)} = 0,
$$
indicating that the knowledge remains frozen at $$\textcolor{#5DADEC}{K(t_0)}$$. Over time, as $$t \to \infty$$, the divergence between $$K(t)$$ and real-world knowledge widens, resulting in increasingly outdated or inaccurate outputs.
<div class="box-important" markdown="1">
#### Real-World Implications
This static nature is especially problematic in domains such as:

- Medicine, where evolving treatment protocols and research are critical <d-cite key="ji2022"></d-cite>.
- Law, where changes in regulations or precedents can render older knowledge obsolete.

Without mechanisms to dynamically update $$\Delta K(t)$$, LLMs fail to provide accurate, timely information in these high-stakes environments.
</div>

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">2. Compounded Errors in Reasoning</span>

In multi-step reasoning, LLMs encounter a **cascading error problem**, where inaccuracies at each step propagate and amplify in subsequent steps <d-cite key="bender2021"></d-cite>. 

#### Quantifying Error Propagation
Let $$P(x_n)$$ denote the probability of correctness at reasoning step $$n$$. The overall probability of correctness across $$N$$ steps is given by:
$$
P_{\text{total}} = \prod_{n=1}^N \textcolor{#0f941b}{P(x_n)}.
$$
Since $$\textcolor{#0f941b}{P(x_n)} < 1$$ in most real-world scenarios, $$P_{\text{total}}$$ decays exponentially as $$N$$ increases. This exponential decay illustrates how longer reasoning chains magnify errors, making LLMs less reliable for complex tasks <d-cite key="wei2022"></d-cite>.

#### Modeling Error Interactions

Error propagation can also be modeled using second-order interactions through the Hessian matrix <d-cite key="bishop1992"></d-cite>:
$$
H_{ij} = \frac{\partial^2 \textcolor{#E74C3C}{E}}{\partial x_i \partial x_j}. 
$$

To represent this interaction in matrix form, the Hessian matrix can be visualized as:

<div class="matrix-box">
$$
H = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial^2 \textcolor{#E74C3C}{E}}{\partial x_1^2} & \frac{\partial^2 \textcolor{#E74C3C}{E}}{\partial x_1 \partial x_2} & \cdots & \frac{\partial^2 \textcolor{#E74C3C}{E}}{\partial x_1 \partial x_n} \\
\frac{\partial^2 \textcolor{#E74C3C}{E}}{\partial x_2 \partial x_1} & \frac{\partial^2 \textcolor{#E74C3C}{E}}{\partial x_2^2} & \cdots & \frac{\partial^2 \textcolor{#E74C3C}{E}}{\partial x_2 \partial x_n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\frac{\partial^2 \textcolor{#E74C3C}{E}}{\partial x_n \partial x_1} & \frac{\partial^2 \textcolor{#E74C3C}{E}}{\partial x_n \partial x_2} & \cdots & \frac{\partial^2 \textcolor{#E74C3C}{E}}{\partial x_n^2}
\end{bmatrix}
$$
</div>

where:
- $$H_{ij}$$ quantifies how an error in dimension $$x_i$$ interacts with errors in dimension $$x_j$$.
- $$\textcolor{#E74C3C}{E}$$ is the error function dependent on reasoning dimensions $$x_i$$.

This matrix representation highlights the symmetry of the Hessian ($$H_{ij} = H_{ji}$$), demonstrating how second-order effects capture complex interactions between dimensions. By modeling these interactions, we can better understand how errors propagate and amplify through reasoning pathways. This indicates that inaccuracies are not isolated; instead, they cascade through interconnected reasoning pathways, compounding the overall error and making multi-step reasoning increasingly unreliable in LLMs.
## Limitations of Existing Approaches

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Fine-Tuning</span>

<figure style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="{{ 'assets/img/2025-04-28-streamlining-factual-validation/finetuning.png' | relative_url }}">
    <figcaption style="font-size: 15px; text-align: left; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 800px;">
        <strong>Figure 2.</strong> Workflow showing LLM fine-tuning with domain-specific data, integrating fine-tuned datasets to produce specialized responses.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

Fine-tuning involves retraining LLMs on domain-specific datasets, improving their factual accuracy within specific contexts <d-cite key="howard2018"></d-cite>. However, it has inherent trade-offs:

- High resource requirements make it impractical for many organizations and individuals <d-cite key="zhang2022"></d-cite>.
- Static knowledge freezes models in time, necessitating constant retraining to stay relevant <d-cite key="bommasani2021"></d-cite>.
- Specialization often comes at the expense of general-purpose utility, limiting versatility <d-cite key="ruder2019"></d-cite>.

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</span>

<figure style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="{{ 'assets/img/2025-04-28-streamlining-factual-validation/rag.png' | relative_url }}">
    <figcaption style="font-size: 15px; text-align: left; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 800px;">
        <strong>Figure 3.</strong> Workflow showing external data retrieval and integration with the LLM to generate grounded responses.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

RAG pipelines integrate external knowledge retrieval into the LLM workflow, providing factual grounding by leveraging curated databases or search engines <d-cite key="ibm2023"></d-cite>. While effective in many cases, RAG systems face challenges:

- **Data Dependence**: Retrieved information may be incomplete, outdated, or biased, directly affecting output reliability <d-cite key="lewis2020"></d-cite>.
- **Validation Gap**: RAG systems retrieve information but do not inherently validate it, leaving unresolved conflicts between retrieved facts and the LLM’s internal predictions <d-cite key="karpukhin2020"></d-cite>.
- **Scalability**: As query complexity increases, retrieved information can become overly sparse, and the increasing contextual length can diminish its enhancement for the LLM, ultimately restricting scalability <d-cite key="laban2024"></d-cite>.

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Post-Hoc Validation</span>

<figure style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="{{ 'assets/img/2025-04-28-streamlining-factual-validation/posthoc.png' | relative_url }}">
    <figcaption style="font-size: 15px; text-align: left; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 800px;">
        <strong>Figure 4.</strong> Workflow showing validation of LLM-generated responses against external datasets, with flagged issues reprocessed for accuracy.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

Post-hoc validation attempts to correct inaccuracies after generation by cross-referencing outputs with external datasets or models <d-cite key="zhong2024"></d-cite>. While valuable, it struggles from inefficiencies:

- It introduces latency, making it unsuitable for real-time applications.
- Validating every output, even when unnecessary, wastes computational resources <d-cite key="guu2020"></d-cite>.
- It provides limited feedback for refining the underlying generative process, addressing symptoms but not root causes <d-cite key="li2024"></d-cite>.

## Theoretical Foundations

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Factual Validation: Core Principles</span>

Factual validation ensures that LLM outputs are verifiable and contextually accurate. This approach is guided by two main principles:

- **Granularity**: Responses are decomposed into discrete factual units for precise validation, reducing the likelihood of undetected inaccuracies <d-cite key="maynez2020"></d-cite>.

  Mathematically, a generated response $$R$$ is represented as:
  $$
  R = \{\textcolor{#1f77b4}{F_1}, \textcolor{#ff7f0e}{F_2}, \dots, \textcolor{#2ca02c}{F_n}\},
  $$
  where each $$F_i$$ represents a discrete factual unit, such as a statement or claim.  

  #### Example:
  
  $$
  R = \{\text{"Paris is the capital of France"}, \text{"The Eiffel Tower is in Paris"}\}.
  $$

  Validation is performed by comparing each $$F_i$$ against a knowledge base $$K$$, which contains validated information:
  
  $$
  K = \{\text{"Paris is the capital of France"}, \text{"The Eiffel Tower is in Paris"}\}.
  $$
  
  A factual unit $$F_i$$ is considered valid if it exists in $$K$$:
  $$
  V(F_i) = 
  \begin{cases} 
  1 & \text{if } F_i \in K, \\
  0 & \text{otherwise.}
  \end{cases}
  $$

  The overall validation score for the response is calculated as:
  $$
  V(R) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} V(F_i)}{n},
  $$
  where $$V(R) \in [0, 1]$$ quantifies the proportion of factual units in $$R$$ that are verified by $$K$$.

- **Scalability**: Validation systems leverage vectorized representations to efficiently compare outputs against large, structured knowledge bases <d-cite key="karpukhin2020"></d-cite>. Instead of exact string matching, factual units $$F_i$$ are mapped into a high-dimensional vector space for efficient comparisons. 

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">The Role of Vectorization</span>

Vectorization encodes atomic facts into high-dimensional representations (**embeddings**) that facilitate efficient storage, retrieval, and comparison <d-cite key="johnson2017"></d-cite>.  

Each factual unit $$F_i$$ is transformed into an embedding:
$$
\mathbf{v}_i = \textcolor{#1f77b4}{\text{Encode}(F_i)},
$$
where $$\text{Encode}(\cdot)$$ maps textual data to numerical vectors.

#### Example:

$$
F_i = \text{"Paris is the capital of France"}
$$
$$
\mathbf{v}_i = [0.12, 0.45, 0.67, \dots, 0.89]
$$

The knowledge base $$K$$ is also represented as a set of embeddings:
$$
K = \{\mathbf{k}_1, \mathbf{k}_2, \dots, \mathbf{k}_m\}.
$$

To validate $$F_i$$, the similarity between $$\mathbf{v}_i$$ and $$\mathbf{k}_j$$ is measured using cosine similarity:
$$
\text{Sim}(\mathbf{v}_i, \mathbf{k}_j) = \frac{\mathbf{v}_i \cdot \mathbf{k}_j}{\|\mathbf{v}_i\| \|\mathbf{k}_j\|}.
$$

**Cosine Similarity**: Determines how closely aligned two vectors are in high-dimensional space (range: -1 to 1):
- $$1$$: Identical vectors.
- $$-1$$: Completely opposite vectors.

A factual unit $$F_i$$ is considered valid if:
$$
\max_{j} \text{Sim}(\mathbf{v}_i, \mathbf{k}_j) \geq \tau,
$$
where $$\tau$$ is a predefined similarity threshold <d-cite key="reimers2019"></d-cite>. This ensures that validation considers **semantic similarity** rather than exact matches.

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Combining Granularity and Vectorization</span>

Factual validation combines the precision of granularity with the efficiency of vectorization to determine the validity of responses. The process involves:

1. **Decompose Response**: Break $$R$$ into:
   $$
   R = \{\textcolor{#1f77b4}{F_1}, \textcolor{#ff7f0e}{F_2}, \dots, \textcolor{#2ca02c}{F_n}\}.
   $$

2. **Encode Units**: Transform each $$F_i$$ into its high-dimensional embedding:
   $$
   \mathbf{v}_i = \text{Encode}(F_i).
   $$

3. **Compare with Knowledge Base**: Use cosine similarity to validate $$\mathbf{v}_i$$ against $$K$$:
   $$
   \max_{j} \text{Sim}(\mathbf{v}_i, \mathbf{k}_j) \geq \tau.
   $$

The overall validation score is computed as:
$$
V(R) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathbb{1} \left( \max_{j} \text{Sim}(\mathbf{v}_i, \mathbf{k}_j) \geq \tau \right)}{n},
$$
where $$\mathbb{1}(\cdot)$$ is the indicator function that outputs 1 if the condition is satisfied and 0 otherwise.

**This approach ensures**:
1. **Precision** at the **component level** (granularity).  
2. **Scalability** across **large knowledge bases** (vectorization) <d-cite key="guu2020"></d-cite>.

## Our Proposal: Fact-Based Validation for GPT Systems
To address the challenges of ensuring factual accuracy in GPT systems, we propose a framework that preprocesses data into structured and verifiable units with the aim to enhance the reliability of LLM-generated responses while optimizing storage and retrieval efficiency.

<figure style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="{{ 'assets/img/2025-04-28-streamlining-factual-validation/method.png' | relative_url }}">
    <figcaption style="font-size: 15px; text-align: left; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 800px;">
        <strong>Figure 5.</strong> This diagram illustrates the workflow of the LLM Validity Judger. The system fetches relevant facts from a vector database, generates responses based on this context, and simplifies outputs into factual statements. It validates these statements by comparing them with the vector database, generating an overall validity score and explanation. The process repeats with feedback until a valid result is achieved. The diagram also includes the New Data Input System, which independently adds summarized and verified facts into the vector database, ensuring its relevance and accuracy. For clarity, the fetching system mirrors standard vector database retrieval processes.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">System Architecture</span>

- **New Data Input System**: Fact Extraction and Storage  
  - **Input**: Multiple text chunks containing factual information.  
  - **Output**: Extracted facts embedded as vector representations, stored in a vector database.

- **LLM Validity Judger**: Prompt and Response Validation  
  - **Input**: A GPT prompt and its corresponding response.  
  - **Output**: A validity rating between 0 and 1 indicating the accuracy of the prompt/response pair, along with optional reasoning.

## Implementation Details
<span style="font-size: 25px; font-weight: bold;">New Data Input System</span>

**Fetching Contexts**: All contexts are fetched from the PubmedQA dataset to serve as the input data for preprocessing <d-cite key="jin2019"></d-cite>.

**Summarization and Compression**: Each context is summarized using GPT-4o-mini, compressing the content into concise paragraphs. This step ensures efficient downstream processing and storage <d-cite key="gpt4omini"></d-cite>.

**Embedding with OpenAI Models**: The summarized contexts are embedded into high-dimensional vector representations using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large model <d-cite key="openaidocs"></d-cite>.

**Clustering with DBSCAN**: The embeddings are grouped into clusters using DBSCAN, which identifies similar contexts without requiring predefined categories. This step is critical for organizing related data efficiently <d-cite key="ester1996"></d-cite>.

**Context Combination and Summarization**: Context summaries within each cluster are combined and re-summarized into unified representations using GPT-4o-mini, further reducing redundancy and optimizing coherence <d-cite key="gpt4omini"></d-cite>.

**Final Embedding and Storage**: The new summaries are re-embedded with text-embedding-3-large <d-cite key="openaidocs"></d-cite>. These embeddings, along with any unclustered individual summaries, are stored in PineconeDB for retrieval <d-cite key="pinecone"></d-cite>.

<span style="font-size: 25px; font-weight: bold;">LLM Validity Judger</span>

**Decomposing Responses**: GPT processes the prompt and its corresponding response, breaking them into discrete factual statements. Each statement is assigned an importance score (0–1), indicating its relevance to the prompt.

**Proximity Search**: For each statement, the system retrieves five of the closest facts from the vector database through a semantic proximity search <d-cite key="johnson2017"></d-cite>. These facts serve as the context for validation.

**Validity Scoring**: Each statement is evaluated against its contextual facts using GPT, which assigns a validity score between 0 and 1 based on alignment. This evaluation determines how well the statement aligns with retrieved facts <d-cite key="kryscinski2019"></d-cite>.

**Weighted Average Calculation**: The validity scores are aggregated into a weighted average, where the weights are derived from the importance scores of the statements. This weighted score represents the overall factual accuracy of the response.

**Explainability**: If required, GPT generates a rationale for the validity rating, outlining which facts were used, how alignment was determined, and any potential conflicts. This reasoning enhances interpretability and transparency.

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Why Not KNN for Clustering?</span>

K-nearest neighbor (KNN) was considered for fact clustering but was ultimately not used due to its reliance on predefined parameters, such as the number of clusters or neighbors—constraints that are impractical for real-world datasets with high diversity <d-cite key="taunk2019"></d-cite>. In contrast, DBSCAN identifies clusters based on density, eliminating the need for prior knowledge of the dataset's structure <d-cite key="ester1996"></d-cite>. This makes DBSCAN more effective for processing unstructured or unknown data distributions. Additionally, KNN's approach risks significant data abstraction or loss when attempting to condense diverse facts into singular representations, worsening the system's ability to maintain factual granularity <d-cite key="cunningham2020"></d-cite>.

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Additional Note</span>

If the dataset is preprocessed to isolate one specific fact per entry, we recommend bypassing that step. Instead, the data can directly enter our model, which dynamically groups related facts. This approach preserves the richness of the dataset and streamlines the overall workflow.

## Advantages of This System

- **Granular Verification**: Validates individual facts for higher precision compared to document- or paragraph-level assessments.
- **Simple Integration**: This system can be integrated into existing RAG infrastructure to enhance the overall functionality without requiring infrastructure changes.
- **Efficient Storage**: Compresses data through summarization and clustering, reducing storage needs and retrieval token usage.
- **Fact-Level Accuracy**: Ensures validity by requiring agreement across multiple sources before storing facts.
- **Real-Time Validation**: Enables fast, efficient validation within the generation process.
- **Scalable**: Modular design scales across datasets and domains, ensuring long-term applicability.

## Experimentation and Results

We evaluated our proposed pipeline by benchmarking it against the Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline using the PubmedQA dataset <d-cite key="jin2019"></d-cite>. The evaluation focused on three key metrics: factual accuracy, RAG effectiveness, and storage efficiency, collectively measuring response quality, retrieval precision, and data storage optimization.

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Traditional RAG Pipeline</span>

The traditional RAG pipeline was tested under ideal conditions, embedding and retrieving the labeled contexts directly from the PubmedQA dataset <d-cite key="jin2019"></d-cite>. This setup provided perfect access to the correct answer contexts, offering a significant advantage. Despite this, our proposed pipeline—which applies summarization and compression—demonstrates performance comparable to this baseline, underscoring its effectiveness.

The traditional pipeline workflow includes the following steps:
- Fetch all contexts from the PubmedQA dataset <d-cite key="jin2019"></d-cite>.
- Embed each context using OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-large` model.
- Store the embeddings in PineconeDB for retrieval.

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Comparative Metrics</span>

| **Metric**           | **Traditional Pipeline** | **Proposed Pipeline** | **Difference**            |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Factual Accuracy      | 71.7%                   | 71.2%                 | -0.5%                    |
| RAG Effectiveness     | 99.2%                   | 98.9%                 | -0.3%                    |
| Storage Efficiency    | 1,351 KB                | 571 KB                | -57.7% (Reduction)       |

**Table 1.** Comparison of factual accuracy, RAG effectiveness, and storage efficiency between the traditional pipeline and the proposed pipeline. The proposed pipeline achieves comparable performance in accuracy and effectiveness while significantly reducing storage requirements by 57.7%.

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Factual Accuracy</span>

We tested factual accuracy to measure how well the system addressed prompts by integrating all processes, including context retrieval, summarization, and LLM response generation. Using the PubmedQA dataset with 1,000 labeled context-question-answer groups, we queried each question and deemed responses correct if they matched the dataset’s answer (yes, no, or maybe) <d-cite key="jin2019"></d-cite>. The traditional pipeline achieved 71.7% accuracy, while our pipeline achieved 71.2%, a negligible difference of 0.5%. This suggests that summarizing contexts did not hinder the LLM’s ability to generate correct answers. Further improvements in prompt engineering or summary generation could potentially surpass the traditional pipeline’s accuracy.

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">RAG Effectiveness</span>

RAG effectiveness was evaluated to determine how well each pipeline retrieved the most relevant context for a given query. The PubmedQA dataset contexts were queried using labeled questions, and a retrieval was marked correct if the top result matched the labeled correct context <d-cite key="jin2019"></d-cite>. The traditional pipeline achieved 99.2% RAG effectiveness, while our pipeline achieved 98.9%, a minor 0.3% difference. The minimal reduction shows that summarization and clustering do not compromise retrieval quality. Additionally, granting the proposed pipeline access to original embeddings instead of summaries for labeling could eliminate this gap entirely, further reinforcing its effectiveness.

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Storage Efficiency</span>

We measured storage efficiency by calculating the total size of stored contexts in the vector database (excluding vector embeddings). The traditional pipeline required 1,351 KB, whereas our pipeline used only 571 KB, a reduction of 57.7%. This demonstrates the significant compression achieved through summarization and clustering. The benefits are particularly pronounced in unstructured datasets, where redundant data can be consolidated. While PubmedQA is a structured dataset, in more diverse real-world datasets, the proposed pipeline would likely achieve even greater storage savings. This reduced footprint allows for the storage of larger datasets and faster query times, providing scalability without sacrificing usability.

## Broader Implications

The results of this pipeline highlight its potential to advance how RAG systems handle unstructured and large-scale datasets. Its ability to compress and organize data effectively expands the capacity of vector databases, enabling systems to manage larger and more diverse datasets without sacrificing query performance. This scalability is critical for real-time applications and resource-constrained environments like edge computing <d-cite key="yao2024"></d-cite>.

The modular design ensures easy integration with existing RAG systems, supporting seamless adoption while allowing for domain-specific customization. By balancing efficiency, scalability, and accuracy, this framework contributes to more practical and reliable AI systems.

## Limitations and Future Work

1. **Suboptimal Context Fit**:
- The data retrieved may not always align perfectly with the prompt, leading to potential mismatches in utility. 
- **Mitigation**: Introduce additional retrieval steps that identify and remove irrelevant facts, guided by LLM evaluations.

2. **Validity Scoring Challenges**:
- Validity ratings based on retrieved facts may lack precision due to ambiguous LLM prompts or insufficient contextual grounding. 
- **Mitigation**: Provide scoring examples during prompting or fine-tune the LLM to compute scores more reliably from source data.

3. **Context Sensitivity Issues**:
- Facts may be accurate in isolation but misleading when applied in certain contexts, limiting the system's adaptability. 
- **Mitigation**: Extend vector embeddings to include source and context information, enabling the system to incorporate situational nuances.

4. **Potential Source Bias**:
- Bias in the original source documents can propagate into the system, affecting the impartiality of responses. 
- **Mitigation**: Add a preprocessing step to evaluate and mitigate biases in source data before vectorization.

5. **Scope of Accuracy**:
- The system prioritizes factual accuracy without focusing on other dimensions of response quality, such as creative inference or prompt analysis.
- **Mitigation**: Include additional validity metrics, such as evaluating inferential accuracy or alignment with the original prompt, using separate GPT evaluations.

6. **Expanded Dataset Evaluation**:
- Due to time constraints, the system was tested only on PubmedQA and did not undergo evaluation on a broader range of datasets. This limitation restricts the full assessment of the method’s scalability and effectiveness across all data types.
- **Mitigation**: Future work aims on expanding the evaluation to include additional benchmark datasets, such as SimpleQA <d-cite key="simpleqa"></d-cite>. Sources like Wikipedia pages and news articles will be scraped and processed into the vector database to better assess the pipeline's performance under real-world conditions.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored a novel framework for enhancing the efficiency and scalability of RAG pipelines while maintaining high standards of factual accuracy. By incorporating techniques such as summarization, clustering, and vectorized fact storage, we demonstrated how preprocessing can substantially reduce storage and optimize context management.

Our experimentation with the PubmedQA dataset highlighted the pipeline’s ability to perform competitively with traditional methods with ideal access to labeled contexts. These findings accentuate the potential of fact validation strategies to balance accuracy and efficiency, advancing trust in AI systems and paving the way for future innovations in managing unstructured data and large-scale knowledge retrieval.
