title: ViT Baseline Revisited # — Debugging ViT, RandAugment, and Inception Crop implementations
description: ViT (vision transformer) has emerged as a major model family for computer vision
  with the same architecture as that of dominant LLMs and performance matching or exceeding that of
  the CNN-based ResNet-like models. Shortly after the ICLR publication, a note was published to
  follow up with better performance of the smaller ViT-S/16 variant on the ImageNet-1k dataset. In
  our effort to reproduce that, we find inconsistencies among major implementations of ViT,
  RandAugment, and Inception crop that impact model performance. We achieve better performance with
  90 / 150 epoch training budget and call for better awareness of implementation discrepancies.

## Introduction

The dawn of the deep learning era is marked by the "Imagenet moment", when Alexnet won the
ILSVRC-2012 competition for classifying the ImageNet-1k dataset <d-cite key="10.1145/3065386"></d-cite>.
Since then, the field of CV (computer vision) had been dominated by deep CNNs (convolutional neural networks),
especially ResNet-like ones featuring residual connections <d-cite key="7780459"></d-cite>. In 2020,
however, Dosovitskiy et al. proposed vision transformer (ViT) <d-cite key="dosovitskiy2020image"></d-cite>,
which uses transformer architecture that is already dominating the field of language modeling for CV.
With competitive performance, ViT is now widely adapted not only for CV tasks, but also as a component
for vision-language models <d-cite key="radford2021learning"></d-cite>.

    ViT architecture. Images are divided into square patches, which are then linearly projected into
    tokens. After adding position embedding, the tokens are fed to the pre-norm transformer encoder.
    In the original architecture, an extra classification token is added to the input sequence and
    its output is used for classification ("token pooling"). Figure from <d-cite key="dosovitskiy2020image"></d-cite>.
</div>

Since transformer encoder is permutation-invariant, ViT is considered to have weaker inductive bias
and relies more on model regularization or data augmentation, especially at smaller scale <d-cite key="steiner2022how"></d-cite>.
It is therefore particularly notable that Beyer et al. published a short note claiming that ViT-S/16
can achieve better metrics on the ImageNet-1k dataset than ResNet-50 <d-cite key="beyer2022better"></d-cite>.
With manageable compute requirement and open-sourced Big Vision repo <d-cite key="big_vision"></d-cite>
as the reference implementation, we decide to reproduce it in the PyTorch <d-cite key="Ansel_PyTorch_2_Faster_2024"></d-cite>
ecosystem as the entry point to ViT research.

<div class="caption">
    A few common ViT sizes. <d-cite key="beyer2022better"></d-cite> and this blogpost exclusively
    focuses on ViT-S/16, a variant of ViT-S with patch size $16 \times 16$. Table from <d-cite key="steiner2022how"></d-cite>.
</div>

## Implementation discrepancies

The variant of ViT-S/16 used in <d-cite key="beyer2022better"></d-cite> differs from the original ViT:

1. Instead of token pooling, average of all the output tokens ("global average-pooling", GAP) <d-cite key="9711302"></d-cite> is fed to the MLP head for classification.
2. Fixed 2D sin-cos position embeddings <d-cite key="9711302"></d-cite> is used instead of learned position embeddings.

The model is then trained with Inception crop <d-cite key="7298594"></d-cite>, random horizontal flips,
RandAugment <d-cite key="NEURIPS2020_d85b63ef"></d-cite>, and Mixup <d-cite key="zhang2018mixup"></d-cite>.
Furthermore, there is a variant that replaces the MLP head with a single linear layer that we initially
focus on since it is even simpler and makes "no significant difference" <d-cite key="beyer2022better"></d-cite>.
Sometimes called "simple ViT" <d-cite key="vit-pytorch"></d-cite>, it turns out that there is no up-to-date implementation in PyTorch readily
available<d-footnote>simple_vit.py from vit-pytorch does not support modern attention kernels e.g.
FlashAttention <d-cite key="dao2022flashattention"></d-cite>. The simple_flash_attn_vit.py variant
does but is heavily defensive and resorts to the functional F.scaled_dot_product_attention() for
backward compatibility. </d-footnote>, so we decide to implement our own.

### ViT initialization

It turns out that even building simple ViT from built-in modules from PyTorch requires reinitializing
most of the parameters to match that of the Big Vision reference implementation, including:

1. `torch.nn.MultiheadAttention`

    * `in_proj_weight`: In the most common use case when the value dimension is equal to query and key dimension, their projection matrices are combined into `in_proj_weight` whose
    initial values are [set with `xavier_uniform_()`](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/aafb3deaf1460764432472a749d625f03570a53d/torch/nn/modules/activation.py#L1112).
    Likely unintentionally, this means that the values are sampled from uniform distribution $\mathcal{U}(-a, a)$ where $$a = \sqrt{\frac{3}{2 \text{ hidden_dim}}}$$ instead of $$\sqrt{\frac{3}{\text{hidden_dim}}}$$<d-footnote>This is not the only case where the combined QKV projection matrix misleads shape-aware optimizer and parameter initialization (<a href="https://x.com/kellerjordan0/status/1844820920780947800">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/graphcore-research/unit-scaling/blob/1edf20543439e042cc314667b348d9b4c4480e23/unit_scaling/_modules.py#L479">2</a>). It may be worth reexamining whether this truly leads to better performance and whether it is worth it.</d-footnote>.

    * `out_proj.weight`:  Furthermore, the output projection is [initialized as `NonDynamicallyQuantizableLinear`](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/e62073d7997c9e63896cb5289ffd0874a8cc1838/torch/nn/modules/activation.py#L1097). Just like [`torch.nn.Linear`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Linear.html), its initial weights are sampled from uniform distribution $\mathcal{U}(-a, a)$ where $$a = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\text{hidden_dim}}}$$ instead of $$\sqrt{\frac{3}{\text{hidden_dim}}}$$ <d-footnote>See <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/57109#issuecomment-828847575">pytorch/pytorch#57109 (comment)</a> for the origin of this discrepancy.</d-footnote>.

    To conform with [`jax.nn.initializers.xavier_uniform()` used by the reference implementation](https://github.com/google-research/big_vision/blob/ec86e4da0f4e9e02574acdead5bd27e282013ff1/big_vision/models/vit.py#L93), both are re-initialized with samples from uniform distribution $\mathcal{U}(-a, a)$ where $$a = \sqrt{\frac{3}{\text{hidden_dim}}}$$ <d-footnote>Note that the standard deviation of uniform distribution $\mathcal{U}(-a, a)$ is $$\frac{a}{\sqrt{3}}$$ So this is also the correct initialization for preserving the input scale assuming that the input features are uncorrelated.</d-footnote>.

2. `torch.nn.Conv2d`: Linear projection of flattened patches can be done with 2D convolution, namely
   [`torch.nn.Conv2d` initialized with `in_channels = 3`, `out_channels = hidden_dim`, and both `kernel_size`
   and `stride` set to `patch_size` in PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Conv2d.html).
   `torch.nn.Conv2d`, however, defaults to weight and bias initialization with uniform distribution
   $\mathcal{U}(-a, a)$ where $$a = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\text{fan_in}}}$$ instead of Big Vision's Lecun normal
   (truncated normal) initialization <d-cite key="klambauer2017self"></d-cite> for weight and zero-init for bias.
   Furthermore, [PyTorch's own `nn.init.trunc_normal_()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.init.html#torch.nn.init.trunc_normal_)
   doesn't take the effect of truncation on standard deviation into account unlike [the JAX implementation](https://github.com/google/jax/blob/1949691daabe815f4b098253609dc4912b3d61d8/jax/_src/nn/initializers.py#L334), so we have to implement the correction ourselves:

   <div class="caption">
     <img src="{{ 'assets/img/2025-04-28-vit-baseline-revisited/truncated_normal.png' | relative_url }}" class="img-fluid" width="auto" height="auto">
   </div>

   <div class="caption">
     Unit normal distribution has standard deviation $\sigma = 1$, but after truncating at $\pm 2$
     the standard deviation is reduced to $\sigma = 0.880$. To restore unit standard deviation, one
     needs to sample $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma = \frac{1}{.880})$ instead and truncate at $\pm 2 \sigma$.
   </div>

3. `torch.nn.Linear` for the classification head: Specifically for the classification head, Big Vision
   usually zero-inits both the weight and bias for the linear layer, including the ViT-S/16 in question.
   Notably, neither [`simple_vit.py`](https://github.com/lucidrains/vit-pytorch/blob/141239ca86afc6e1fe6f4e50b60d173e21ca38ec/vit_pytorch/simple_vit.py#L108) nor [`simple_flash_attn_vit.py`](https://github.com/lucidrains/vit-pytorch/blob/141239ca86afc6e1fe6f4e50b60d173e21ca38ec/vit_pytorch/simple_flash_attn_vit.py#L162) from vit-pytorch does this.

After fixing 1-3, we verify that all of the per-layer summary statistics including minimum, maximum,
mean, and standard deviation of the 21,974,632 model parameters at initialization match that of the
Big Vision reference implementation.

### RandAugment

Following <d-cite key="beyer2022better"></d-cite>, we train the model with batch size 1024, training
budget 90 epochs = round(1281167 / 1024 * 90) = 112603 steps, 10000 warm-up steps, cosine learning
rate decay, 1e-3 maximum learning rate, 1e-4 decoupled weight decay <d-cite key="adamw-decoupling-blog"></d-cite>
(0.1 in PyTorch's parameterization before multiplying by the learning rate), AdamW optimizer,
gradient clip with [`max_norm = 1.0`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_.html), Inception
crop with 5%-100% of the area of the original image ("scale"), random horizontal flips,
RandAugment <d-cite key="NEURIPS2020_d85b63ef"></d-cite> with [`num_ops = 2` and `magnitude = 10`](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/generated/torchvision.transforms.v2.RandAugment.html),
and Mixup <d-cite key="zhang2018mixup"></d-cite> with [`alpha = 0.2`](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/generated/torchvision.transforms.v2.MixUp.html).
We also notice that the Big Vision implementation "normalizes" the image with mean = std = (0.5, 0.5, 0.5)
([`value_range(-1, 1)`](https://github.com/google-research/big_vision/blob/46b2456f54b9d4f829d1925b78943372b376153d/big_vision/configs/vit_s16_i1k.py#L52))
and uses [the same neutral RGB value as the fill value for RandAugment](https://github.com/google-research/big_vision/blob/46b2456f54b9d4f829d1925b78943372b376153d/big_vision/pp/archive/autoaugment.py#L676)
and make sure that our reproduction conforms to this training setup. Our reproduction attempt reaches
76.91% top-1 ImageNet-1k validation set accuracy vs. 76.7% for the Head: MLP → linear ablation after
90 epochs as given in <d-cite key="beyer2022better"></d-cite>. However, the training loss and gradient
L2 norm comparison suggests that they are not equivalent:

<div class="caption">
  <img src="{{ 'assets/img/2025-04-28-vit-baseline-revisited/gradient_L2_norm_comparison.png' | relative_url }}" class="img-fluid" width="auto" height="auto">
</div>

It turns out that "RandAugment" in torchVision <d-cite key="torchvision2016"></d-cite> is quite different
from "RandAugment" in Big Vision. RandAugment in torchVision, following the description in the paper <d-cite key="NEURIPS2020_d85b63ef"></d-cite>,
randomly selects one of the following 14 transforms:

||||
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-----:|
|Identity | AutoContrast | Equalize|
|Rotate | Solarize | Color|
|Posterize | Contrast | Brightness|
|Sharpness | ShearX | ShearY|
|TranslateX | TranslateY||

RandAugment in Big Vision, however, [forked](https://github.com/google-research/big_vision/blob/46b2456f54b9d4f829d1925b78943372b376153d/big_vision/pp/archive/autoaugment.py#L20)
from the EfficientNet reference implementation and has a lineup that consists of 16 transforms:

||||
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-----:|
|AutoContrast | Equalize | Rotate|
|Solarize | Color | Posterize|
|Contrast | Brightness | Sharpness|
|ShearX | ShearY | TranslateX|
|TranslateY | Invert | Cutout|
|SolarizeAdd|||

with "Identity" no-op removed and "Invert", "Cutout", and "SolarizeAdd" added to the list. Moreover,
its implementation of the Contrast transform is broken. In short: [the `mean` here](https://github.com/google-research/big_vision/blob/01edb81a4716f93a48be43b3a4af14e29cdb3a7f/big_vision/pp/autoaugment.py#L209-L213)

{% highlight python %}
  # Compute the grayscale histogram, then compute the mean pixel value,
  # and create a constant image size of that value.  Use that as the
  # blending degenerate target of the original image.
  hist = tf.histogram_fixed_width(degenerate, [0, 255], nbins=256)
  mean = tf.reduce_sum(tf.cast(hist, tf.float32)) / 256.0
{% endhighlight %}

is supposed to be the mean pixel value, but as it is it's just summing over the histogram (therefore
equal to height * width), divided by 256. The correct implementation should be

{% highlight python %}
  image_height = tf.shape(image)[0]
  image_width = tf.shape(image)[1]
  # Compute the grayscale histogram, then compute the mean pixel value,
  # and create a constant image size of that value.  Use that as the
  # blending degenerate target of the original image.
  hist = tf.histogram_fixed_width(degenerate, [0, 255], nbins=256)
  mean = tf.reduce_sum(
      tf.cast(hist, tf.float32) * tf.linspace(0., 255., 256)) / float(image_height * image_width)
{% endhighlight %}

or [as suggested by @yeqingli, just call `tf.image.adjust_contrast()` for the whole function](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/pull/11219#discussion_r1792502043):

{% highlight python %}
def contrast(image: tf.Tensor, factor: float) -> tf.Tensor:
  return tf.image.adjust_contrast(image, factor)
{% endhighlight %}

We can experimentally confirm and visualize this using a calibration grid. For example, given the
$224 \times 224$ grid below that consists of (192, 64, 64) and (64, 192, 192) squares:

<div class="caption">
  <img src="{{ 'assets/img/2025-04-28-vit-baseline-revisited/color_grid.png' | relative_url }}" class="img-fluid" width="auto" height="auto">
</div>

`contrast(tf_color_tile, 1.9)` before the fix returns a grid with (188, 0, 0) and (0, 188, 188) squares:
<div class="caption">
  <img src="{{ 'assets/img/2025-04-28-vit-baseline-revisited/broken_result.png' | relative_url }}" class="img-fluid" width="auto" height="auto">
</div>

After the fix, `contrast(tf_color_tile, 1.9)` returns a grid with (249, 6, 6) and (6, 249, 249) squares instead:
<div class="caption">
  <img src="{{ 'assets/img/2025-04-28-vit-baseline-revisited/correct_result.png' | relative_url }}" class="img-fluid" width="auto" height="auto">
</div>

Another problematic transform is the Solarize transform, [whose augmentation strength varies unintuitively with `magnitude` and is in danger of uint8 overflow](https://github.com/google-research/big_vision/issues/110).
It just happens to behave as expected with [`randaug(2, 10)`](https://github.com/google-research/big_vision/blob/ec86e4da0f4e9e02574acdead5bd27e282013ff1/big_vision/configs/vit_s16_i1k.py#L57) in our case.

As for the discrepancy between torchVision's RandAugment and Big Vision's RandAugment, we can also
use a calibration grid to confirm and visualize. Given the following $224 \times 224$ black & white
calibration grid:

<div class="caption">
  <img src="{{ 'assets/img/2025-04-28-vit-baseline-revisited/calibration_grid.png' | relative_url }}" class="img-fluid" width="auto" height="auto">
</div>

We apply both versions of `RandAugment(2, 10)` 100000 times ([notebook](https://github.com/EIFY/mup-vit/blob/e35ab281acb88f669b18555603d9187a194ccc2f/notebooks/RandAugmentOnCalibrationGrid.ipynb)) to gather the stats. All of the resulting pixels remain colorless (i.e. for RGB values (r, g, b), r == g == b) so
we can sort them from black to white into a spectrum ([notebook](https://github.com/EIFY/mup-vit/blob/e35ab281acb88f669b18555603d9187a194ccc2f/notebooks/GradientVisual.ipynb)).
For the following $2000 \times 200$ spectra, pixels are sorted top-down, left-right, and each pixel represents 224 * 224 * 100000 / (2000 * 200) = 112 * 112 pixels of the aggregated output, amounting to 1/4 of one output image. In case one batch of 12544 pixels happens to be of different values, we take the average. Here is the spectrum of torchvision's `RandAugment(2, 10)`:

<div class="caption">
  <img src="{{ 'assets/img/2025-04-28-vit-baseline-revisited/torch_vision_randaugment_2_10.png' | relative_url }}" class="img-fluid" width="auto" height="auto">
</div>

Here is the spectrum of torchvision's `RandAugment(2, 10, fill=[128] * 3)`. We can see that it just shifts the zero-padding part of the black to the (128, 128, 128) neutral gray:

<div class="caption">
  <img src="{{ 'assets/img/2025-04-28-vit-baseline-revisited/torch_vision_randaugment_2_10_mid_fill.png' | relative_url }}" class="img-fluid" width="auto" height="auto">
</div>

And here is the spectrum of big_vision's `randaug(2, 10)`:

<div class="caption">
  <img src="{{ 'assets/img/2025-04-28-vit-baseline-revisited/big_vision_randaugment_2_10.png' | relative_url }}" class="img-fluid" width="auto" height="auto">
</div>

We end up subclassing torchvision's [`v2.RandAugment`](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/generated/torchvision.transforms.v2.RandAugment.html)([notebook](https://github.com/EIFY/mup-vit/blob/e35ab281acb88f669b18555603d9187a194ccc2f/notebooks/RandAugmentCalibration.ipynb)) in order to
remove and add transforms to match the lineup of Big Vision's RandAugment. We use a variety of
calibration grids to make sure that all transforms give results within $\pm 1$ of the RGB values given by the Big Vision
counterpart, except the Contrast transform for which we decide against replicating the bug. Even with
that exception, the near-replication of big_vision's `randaug(2, 10)` results in near-identical spectrum:

<div class="caption">
  <img src="{{ 'assets/img/2025-04-28-vit-baseline-revisited/torch_vision_randaugment17_2_10.png' | relative_url }}" class="img-fluid" width="auto" height="auto">
</div>

Before we move on: credit to [@tobiasmaier for first noticing the contrast bug and submitting a PR to fix it](https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu/pull/764).
Apparently, some CV people are aware of the bug and the discrepancy between the RandAugment
implemenations. To our best knowledge however, these issues are not publcally documented anywhere.

### Inception crop

Model trained with the near-replication of Big Vision's `randaug(2, 10)` for 90 epochs
[reaches 77.27% top-1 validation set accuracy and the gradient L2 norm looks the same, but the training loss still differs](https://api.wandb.ai/links/eify/8d0wix47):

<div class="caption">
  <img src="{{ 'assets/img/2025-04-28-vit-baseline-revisited/inception_crop_l2_grads_discrepancy.png' | relative_url }}" class="img-fluid" width="auto" height="auto">
  <img src="{{ 'assets/img/2025-04-28-vit-baseline-revisited/inception_crop_training_loss_discrepancy.png' | relative_url }}" class="img-fluid" width="auto" height="auto">
</div>

It turns out that besides the default min scale ([8%](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/generated/torchvision.transforms.v2.RandomResizedCrop.html)
vs. [5%](https://github.com/google-research/big_vision/blob/01edb81a4716f93a48be43b3a4af14e29cdb3a7f/big_vision/pp/ops_image.py#L199)),
the "Inception crop" implemented as torchvision [`v2.RandomResizedCrop()`](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/generated/torchvision.transforms.v2.RandomResizedCrop.html)
is not the same as calling [`tf.slice()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/slice) with the bbox returned by
[`tf.image.sample_distorted_bounding_box()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/image/sample_distorted_bounding_box)
as it is commonly done in JAX / TF:

1. They both rejection-sample the crop, but [`v2.RandomResizedCrop()`](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/generated/torchvision.transforms.v2.RandomResizedCrop.html)
is hardcoded to try 10 times while [`tf.image.sample_distorted_bounding_box()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/image/sample_distorted_bounding_box)
defaults to 100 attempts.
2. [`v2.RandomResizedCrop()`](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/generated/torchvision.transforms.v2.RandomResizedCrop.html) samples the aspect ratio uniformly in log space,
[`tf.image.sample_distorted_bounding_box()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/image/sample_distorted_bounding_box) samples uniformly in linear space.
3. [`v2.RandomResizedCrop()`](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/generated/torchvision.transforms.v2.RandomResizedCrop.html) samples the area cropped uniformly while
[`tf.image.sample_distorted_bounding_box()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/image/sample_distorted_bounding_box) samples the crop height uniformly given the aspect ratio and area range.
4. If all attempts fail, [`v2.RandomResizedCrop()`](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/generated/torchvision.transforms.v2.RandomResizedCrop.html) at least crops the image to make sure that the aspect ratio falls within range before resizing. [`tf.image.sample_distorted_bounding_box()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/image/sample_distorted_bounding_box) just returns the whole image to be resized.

We can verify this by taking stats of the crop sizes given the same image. Here is the density plot of
(h, w) returned by `v2.RandomResizedCrop.get_params(..., scale=(0.05, 1.0), ratio=(3/4, 4/3))`,
given an image of (height, width) = (256, 512), N = 10000000:

  <img src="{{ 'assets/img/2025-04-28-vit-baseline-revisited/torch_hw_counts.png' | relative_url }}" class="img-fluid" width="auto" height="auto">
</div>

There is a total of 14340 crop failures resulting in a bright pixel at the bottom right, but otherwise
the density is roughly uniform. In comparison, here is what `tf.image.sample_distorted_bounding_box(..., area_range=[0.05, 1])` returns:

<div class="caption">
  <img src="{{ 'assets/img/2025-04-28-vit-baseline-revisited/tf_hw_counts.png' | relative_url }}" class="img-fluid" width="auto" height="auto">
</div>

While cropping never failed, we can see clearly that it's oversampling smaller crop areas, as if there
were light shining from top-left ([notebook](https://github.com/EIFY/mup-vit/blob/e35ab281acb88f669b18555603d9187a194ccc2f/notebooks/InceptionCropStats.ipynb)).
We replicate `tf.image.sample_distorted_bounding_box()`'s sampling logic in PyTorch and rerun the experiment by
training a model with it for 90 epochs. At last, both the gradient L2 norm and the training loss match:

<div class="caption">
  <img src="{{ 'assets/img/2025-04-28-vit-baseline-revisited/inception_crop_l2_grads_match.png' | relative_url }}" class="img-fluid" width="auto" height="auto">
  <img src="{{ 'assets/img/2025-04-28-vit-baseline-revisited/inception_crop_training_loss_match.png' | relative_url }}" class="img-fluid" width="auto" height="auto">
</div>

This true reproduction model reaches 76.94% top-1 validation set accuracy after 90 epochs. In summary:

| Model | Top-1 val acc. |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| Reference | 76.7 |
| Same ViT init. in PyTorch | 76.91 |
| + Same RandAugment | **77.27** |
| + Same Inception Crop | 76.94 |

Before we move on: Which implementation is correct? While the reference implementation of the Inception crop
is not publicly available to our best knowledge, here is the relevant excerpt from the paper <d-cite key="szegedy2015going"></d-cite>:

<div class="caption">
  <img src="{{ 'assets/img/2025-04-28-vit-baseline-revisited/Inception_crop_paper_excerpt.png' | relative_url }}" class="img-fluid" width="auto" height="auto">
</div>

While there is some ambiguity in whether aspect ratio should be sampled uniformly in log space or
linear space, it is clear from the description that crop size should be sampled uniformly in crop area.

### Big Vision miscellaneous

Finally <d-footnote>Except the 2nd and 3rd "grafted" experiments, these experiments were run before the true reproduction chronologically.</d-footnote>,
there are a few idiosyncrasies of the Big Vision reference implementation that either are impractical
or do not make sense to replicate. Here we run experiments using the Big Vision repo to test their
effects on model training.

1. In <d-cite key="beyer2022better"></d-cite> only the first 99% of the training data is used for training while the
remaining 1% is used for minival "to encourage the community to stop selecting design choices on the validation (de-facto test) set". This however is
difficult to replicate with [`torchvision.datasets`](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/datasets.html)
since [`datasets.ImageNet()`](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/generated/torchvision.datasets.ImageNet.html)
is ordered by class label, unlike [tfds](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/overview) whose ordering
is somewhat randomized:

    ```python
    import tensorflow_datasets as tfds
    ds = tfds.builder('imagenet2012').as_dataset(split='train[99%:]')
    from collections import Counter
    c = Counter(int(e['label']) for e in ds)
    >>> len(c)
    999
    >>> max(c.values())
    27
    >>> min(c.values())
    3
    ```
Naively trying to do the same with [`torchvision.datasets`](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/datasets.html)
prevents the model from learning the last few classes and results in [near-random performance on the minival](https://api.wandb.ai/links/eify/3ju0jben):
the model only learns the class that happened to stride across the first 99% and the last 1%.
Instead of randomly selecting 99% of the training data or copying the 99% slice given by tfds, we
just fall back to training on 100% of the training data.

2. The reference implementation sets [`shuffle_buffer_size = 250_000`](https://github.com/google-research/big_vision/blob/46b2456f54b9d4f829d1925b78943372b376153d/big_vision/configs/vit_s16_i1k.py#L49)
which is only 20% of the training set, so the training data is not fully shuffled. To fit the data in
a TensorBook, we need to further reduce it to `150_000` and [revive the `utils.accumulate_gradient()`](https://github.com/EIFY/big_vision/commit/e2f74c170d926ab73846ceb9b0d9aad2aa5814af)
function to train with gradient accumulation. 1 and 2 result in 76.74% top-1 validation set accuracy <d-footnote>Perhaps it's worth noting that training on multiple devices vs. single device is not fully equivalent due to the Mixup implementation. With Mixup, the model is trained with <d-cite key="zhang2018mixup"></d-cite>
$$
\begin{align*}
  \tilde{x} &= \lambda x_i + (1 - \lambda) x_j\\
  \tilde{y} &= \lambda y_i + (1 - \lambda) y_j
\end{align*}
$$ where $(x_i, y_i)$ and $(x_j, y_j)$ are (feature vector, one-hot label) sampled from training data and $\lambda$ is randomly sampled from $[0,1]$. In common implementations including that of Big Vision and torchvision, $\lambda$ is only sampled once per batch and $(x_i, y_i)$ and $(x_j, y_j)$ are always from the same batch. Since each device does such <a href="https://github.com/google-research/big_vision/blob/46b2456f54b9d4f829d1925b78943372b376153d/big_vision/train.py#L290-L291">sampling independently</a> in Big Vision, each global batch contains samples mixed-up with $n$ different $\lambda$ values when the model is trained with $n$ devices. That said, we don't expect this to make a difference. Furthermore since both TPUv3-8 and 8x A100-SXM4-40GB have 8 devices total, the Mixup implementation becomes equivalent again after (7.)</d-footnote>.

3. We fix the Contrast transform bug [described above](#randaugment).

4. [Inadvertently the validation set is anti-aliased](https://x.com/giffmana/status/1808394534424138049)
because [the `area` resize method always anti-aliases](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/image/resize),
but not the training set. We change the resize method to `bilinear` with anti-aliasing for both like
the default for [`v2.Reize()`](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/generated/torchvision.transforms.v2.Resize.html#torchvision.transforms.v2.Resize)
and [`v2.RandomResizedCrop()`](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/generated/torchvision.transforms.v2.RandomResizedCrop.html)
in torchvision.

5. [`tf.io.decode_jpeg()` by default lets the system decide the JPEG decompression algorithm](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/io/decode_jpeg). Specifying `dct_method="INTEGER_ACCURATE"` makes it [behave like the PIL/cv2/PyTorch counterpart](https://github.com/google-research/big_vision/blob/01edb81a4716f93a48be43b3a4af14e29cdb3a7f/big_vision/pp/ops_image.py#L39) (see also some quick test at the end of the [notebook](https://github.com/EIFY/mup-vit/blob/e35ab281acb88f669b18555603d9187a194ccc2f/notebooks/RandAugmentCalibration.ipynb)). [We expose this option](https://github.com/EIFY/big_vision/commit/a31822116a9377d6f6dbfbd78372964ed48d8b9a) and test it in our experiment. 1-5 result in 76.87% top-1 validation set accuracy.

6. [`optax.scale_by_adam()` supports the unusual option of using a different dtype for the 1st order accumulator, `mu_dtype`](https://optax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/transformations.html#optax.scale_by_adam) and the reference implementation set it to [`bfloat16`](https://github.com/google-research/big_vision/blob/46b2456f54b9d4f829d1925b78943372b376153d/big_vision/configs/vit_s16_i1k.py#L80) instead of `float32` like the rest of the model. Changing it back to `float32` in addition to 1-5 results in [76.77% top-1 validation set accuracy](https://api.wandb.ai/links/eify/dr9b8q4w).

7. Lastly, we test whether [fully shuffling the training set](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset#fully_shuffling_all_the_data)
helps model performance. We set [`config.input.shuffle_buffer_size = 1281167`](https://github.com/EIFY/big_vision/blob/5adab5c5985f0cd9b2e5fd887a58c062866ab092/big_vision/configs/vit_s16_i1k_8_gpu.py#L50)
and train a model on a 8x A100-SXM4-40GB [Lambda](https://lambdalabs.com/) instance with 1-6 but
no gradient accumulation. The model reaches [76.85% top-1 validation set accuracy](https://api.wandb.ai/links/eify/huigfbka).

8. There is one discrepancy that we choose to ignore: In the Big Vision implementation of the Inception crop
[max (aspect) ratio is set to 1.33](https://github.com/google-research/big_vision/blob/46b2456f54b9d4f829d1925b78943372b376153d/big_vision/pp/ops_image.py#L200),
but in [`v2.RandomResizedCrop()` of torchvision](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/generated/torchvision.transforms.v2.RandomResizedCrop.html) it's set to 4.0/3.0,
with difference well above floating point precision. We don't find it relevant however, and it should be the latter as originally described.

Additionally, for debugging purpose we run 3 "grafted" experiments in which we train and evaluate PyTorch models on the Big Vision data pipelines <d-footnote>The first two grafted experiments are affected by two bugs: One that handles padded input incorrectly and causes the code to underreport top-1 validation set accuracy by a factor of $$\frac{50000}{50176}$$ (<a href="https://github.com/EIFY/big_vision/commit/c6983dbbffaeb21d8c9d7f90caea317b04414fea">bugfix commit</a>) and another that flips height and width of the image (<a href="https://github.com/EIFY/big_vision/commit/3159c33be81b99dff19bcbd6d24f527f255ec7df">bugfix commit</a>). While the latter doesn't result in equivalent models due to the sincos2d position embeddings, we don't believe that it changes the distribution of the reported metric.</d-footnote>. Other than 1-2, the reference Big Vision data pipelines are not further modified beyond necessity. These 3 grafted experiments reach [76.65-76.81% top-1 validation set accuracy](https://api.wandb.ai/links/eify/ey4cmaxx).

In summary:

| Model | Top-1 val acc. |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| Reference | 76.7 |
| 100% training set, smaller shuffle buffer, grad. acc. | 76.74 |
| + contrast() fix, consistent anti-aliasing, accurate JPEG decode | **76.87** |
| + fp32 1st order acc. | 76.77 |
| + full shuffle, no grad. acc. | 76.85 |
| Grafted # 1 | 76.65 |
| Grafted # 2 | 76.81 |
| Grafted # 3 | 76.72 |

The metrics suggest that none of them has any effect. However, this doesn't mean that data pipelines
are interchangeable for trained models. Here is what we observe when we evaluate the models trained on
the Big Vision data pipeline with the torchvision data pipeline, and vice versa:

| Model | torchvision pp | Big Vision pp |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| Grafted # 2 | 76.52 <r>-0.29</r> | 76.81 |
| Grafted # 3 | 76.47 <r>-0.25</r>| 76.72 |
| + Same RandAugment | 77.27 | 77.30 <g>+0.03</g>  |
| + Same Inception Crop | 76.94 | 76.96 <g>+0.02</g> |
| Head: MLP → linear 90ep | 76.83 | 76.86 <g>+0.03</g> |
| Head: MLP → linear 150ep | 78.05 | 77.94 <r>-0.11</r> |
| Head: MLP → linear 300ep | 78.87 | 78.76 <r>-0.11</r> |

Where the Head: MLP → linear experiments are `+ Same RandAugment` models trained in parallel from
the next section. For unknown reasons, models trained on the torchvision data pipeline seem more
robust. To assess and attribute this surprise discrepancy, we compare the validation set images
returned by these two pipelines and measure the L2 difference per pixel after `value_range(-1, 1)` rescaling.
We find that the tfds pipeline returns nearly all exact images if we specify the decoder to be
`tf.io.decode_jpeg(..., dct_method="INTEGER_ACCURATE")` <d-footnote>There is only one nonzero L2 value less than 0.01, for some reason.</d-footnote>.
The difference emerges with the default decoder `tf.io.decode_image` ("Default Decoder"),
which is further exacerbated by resizing and cropping ("Preprocessed", [notebook](https://github.com/EIFY/mup-vit/blob/0c2d0ddc23614b0c0990ec15c46a90ed6ee7b444/notebooks/dataset_comparison.ipynb)):

<div class="caption">
  <img src="{{ 'assets/img/2025-04-28-vit-baseline-revisited/imagenet-ds-diff.png' | relative_url }}" class="img-fluid" width="auto" height="auto">
</div>

Tentatively, we attribute the discrepancy to the long tail of L2 difference after preprocessing.

## Corrected reproduction

To further assess the effect of different implementations, we reproduce the full ablation results
with 90, 150, and 300 epochs of training budget from <d-cite key="beyer2022better"></d-cite> on a
8x A100-SXM4-40GB instance but with the torchvision Inception crop, [`v2.RandomResizedCrop()`](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/generated/torchvision.transforms.v2.RandomResizedCrop.html).
Here is the relevant part of Table 1 from <d-cite key="beyer2022better"></d-cite>:

| Model | 90ep |  150ep | 300ep |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| Our improvements | 76.5 | 78.5 | 80.0 |
| no RandAug+MixUp | 73.6 | 73.7 | 73.7 |
| Posemb: sincos2d → learned | 75.0 | 78.0 | 79.6 |
| Batch-size: 1024 → 4096 | 74.7 | 77.3 | 78.6 |
| Global Avgpool → [cls] token | 75.0 | 76.9 | 78.2 |
| Head: MLP → linear | 76.7 | 78.6 | 79.8 |

Here are our results training the same models with the correct Inception crop. We call their main
approach "better baseline" and we round to the same figure to avoid making them seem more accurate
than they are:

| Model | 90ep |  150ep | 300ep |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| Better baseline | 76.8 <g>+0.3</g> | 78.8 <g>+0.3</g> | 79.6 <r>-0.4</r> |
| no RandAug+MixUp | 73.4 <r>-0.2</r> | 73.5 <r>-0.2</r> | 73.8 <g>+0.1</g> |
| Posemb: sincos2d → learned | 76.2 <g>+1.2</g> | 77.7 <r>-0.3</r> | 79.6 <g>+0.0</g> |
| Batch-size: 1024 → 4096 | 75.6 <g>+0.9</g> | 77.8 <g>+0.5</g> | 78.3 <r>-0.3</r> |
| Global Avgpool → [cls] token | 75.3 <g>+0.3</g> | 77.1 <g>+0.2</g> | 77.5 <r>-0.5</r> |
| Head: MLP → linear | 76.8 <g>+0.1</g> | 78.1 <r>-0.5</r> | 78.9 <r>-0.9</r> |

We first notice that there is quite a bit of variation: In particular, 76.8(3)% for 90ep Head: MLP → linear
is low compared to our previous result 77.27%. Compared to our [grafted experiments](https://github.com/EIFY/big_vision/tree/grafted)
where the variation is $\pm 0.08$ (76.65-76.81%) with random initialization but deterministic (fixed random seed) training data pipeline,
we observe variation of $\pm 0.2$ when both initialization and training data pipeline are randomized.
Regardless, the trend seems to be that the correct Inception crop benefits lower training budget
experiments but shows mixed results for higher training budget. One plausible explanation
is that oversampling smaller crops amounts to stronger augmentation, which tends to benefit
models in the long run <d-footnote>One might be tempted to try curriculum learning with increasing augmentation strength, but early experiments (<a href="https://github.com/EIFY/mup-vit/tree/curriculum">source</a>) result in <a href="https://api.wandb.ai/links/eify/ylnhm3or">76.65-77.35 for 90ep Head: MLP → linear</a>, almost the same range.</d-footnote>. We can also see this by [comparing better baseline with no RandAug+MixUp](https://api.wandb.ai/links/eify/3joh568g):

<div class="caption">
  <img src="{{ 'assets/img/2025-04-28-vit-baseline-revisited/augmentation_tortoise_and_hare.png' | relative_url }}" class="img-fluid" width="auto" height="auto">
</div>

As a setup that is already under-augmented, no RandAug+MixUp itself does not benefit from the
correct Inception crop even with 90ep training budget. We also suspect that it may be possible to
compensate the Inception crop implementation discrepancy by adjusting augmentation strength otherwise,
either through parameters of Inception crop (scale and ratio) or other parts of the augmentation pipeline
(RandAugment and Mixup).

## Schedule-Free baseline

Since the baselines above use cosine learning rate decay with fixed training budget, the learning rate
decays to zero at the end and we can't continue training the model beyond the budget, a limitation
that is subject to much investigation <d-cite key="hagele2024scaling"></d-cite>. More recently, Defazio
et al.<d-cite key="defazio2024road"></d-cite> proposed Schedule-Free optimizers which promise to completely
sidestep the limitation of fixed training budget by making the training process invariant to it. More
specifically, the Schedule-Free AdamW optimizer 1.3 updates the model parameters according to the algorithm:

<div class="caption">
  <img src="{{ 'assets/img/2025-04-28-vit-baseline-revisited/schedule_free_adamw.png' | relative_url }}" class="img-fluid" width="auto" height="auto">
</div>
<div class="caption">
  Pseudocode of the Schedule-Free AdamW optimizer 1.3, modified from <b>Algorithm 1</b> in <d-cite key="defazio2024road"></d-cite>.
</div>

While the gradient is calculated on the $$y$$ sequence, the model should be evaluted on the $$x$$ sequence,
reminiscent of the Polyak-Ruppert average <d-cite key="polyak1992acceleration"></d-cite>. Version 1.3 applies
Adam bias-correction to the 2nd moment gradient estimate instead of the LR [for stability improvement](https://github.com/facebookresearch/schedule_free/pull/49),
with the change highlighted in red above. Our baselines consist of 3 different training budgets, which
serve as a great test ground for Schedule-Free optimizers. Furthermore, Schedule-Free AdamW [has just won
the self-tuning category of the AlgoPerf competition](https://mlcommons.org/2024/08/mlc-algoperf-benchmark-competition/)
which includes the exact same `imagenet_vit` workload that trains ViT-S/16 on ImageNet-1k. It is therefore
of great interest to see whether Schedule-Free AdamW can match the metrics of the 3 baselines by just training
one model. In our first attempt, we again focus on the “better baseline” main approach and keep all the applicable
hyperparameters<d-footnote>torchvision Inception crop, 10000 warm-up steps, 1e-3 maximum learning rate, 1e-4 decoupled weight decay, and gradient clip with <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_.html">max_norm = 1.0</a></d-footnote> and the Schedule-Free AdamW default. For fair comparison,
we make sure that the model is evaluated at the exact same number of steps as the previous 90ep, 150ep,
and 300ep experiments. Lastly, for consistency of presentation, we still compare to the metrics reported in <d-cite key="beyer2022better"></d-cite>.
Here is the result:

| Model | 90ep |  150ep | 300ep |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| Schedule-Free | 76.4 <r>-0.1</r> | 78.4 <r>-0.1</r> | 79.6 <r>-0.4</r> |

Extensive subsequent hyperparameter sweeps fail to meaningfully improve upon it. Here is the rest of
the first LR sweep:

<table align="center">
    <tr>
        <th>LR</th>
        <th>90ep</th>

We then set [`max_norm = 100.0`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_.html)<d-footnote>This effectively removes gradient clipping since it's orders of magnitude larger than the highest logged gradient norm.</d-footnote> and sweep both LR and weight decay (WD):

Interestingly, the optimal decoupled weight decay depends on the learning rate, contrary to <d-cite key="adamw-decoupling-blog"></d-cite>.
Based on this finding, we just use the hyperparameters of Defazio et al.'s AlgoPerf submission <d-cite key="defazio2024road"></d-cite> and
switch back to their coupled weight decay WD=0.08121616522670176, [`max_norm = 100.0`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_.html),
2799 warm-up steps, $\beta_2$=0.9955159689799007, and Polynomial in $c_t$ average = 0.75. We then also
halve and double the learning rate:

These 3 sweeps strongly suggest that we are at the limit of the the Schedule-Free AdamW optimizer.
It turns out that the `imagenet_vit` workload of AlgoPerf <d-cite key="Dahl2023AlgoPerf"></d-cite>
sets the validation target [at only 77.3% top-1 accuracy and `step_hint` at 186_666](https://github.com/mlcommons/algorithmic-efficiency/blob/3c61cc458015ad004f58d4f70e3100124bcf7df2/algorithmic_efficiency/workloads/imagenet_vit/workload.py), meaning that their baseline optimizer sets the learning rate schedule for a fixed budget of 186_666 * 1024 / 1281167 = 149.2, almost 150 epochs.
We find that Schedule-Free AdamW indeed reaches 77.3% top-1 validation set accuracy earlier than our 150ep baseline experiment,
and the top-1 accuracy curve qualitatively matches Figure 7 in Defazio et al. <d-cite key="defazio2024road"></d-cite>.
Given the consistency, we have to conclude that Schedule-Free AdamW can get close but not quite match that of our fixed-budget baselines.
Engineering, however, is about tradeoffs. If the last fractions of percentage points of accuracy are
vital, it's still viable to just train a few $10^3\text{--}10^4$ steps longer in exchange of the potential
of continuing training indefinitely.

## Implication

In the broad sense, the discrepancies in parameter initialization we highlight are likely relevant to
most of the models written in PyTorch and JAX, as long as they use the default

* [`torch.nn.MultiheadAttention`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.MultiheadAttention.html) / [`flax.linen.MultiHeadDotProductAttention`](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.3/_autosummary/flax.linen.MultiHeadDotProductAttention.html)
* [`torch.nn.Linear`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Linear.html) / [`flax.linen.Dense`](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.3/_autosummary/flax.linen.Dense.html)
* [`torch.nn.Conv2d`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Conv2d.html) and other `torch.nn._ConvNd` subclasses / [`flax.linen.Conv`](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.3/_autosummary/flax.linen.Conv.html), or
* [`torch.nn.init.trunc_normal_()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.init.html#torch.nn.init.trunc_normal_) / [`jax.nn.initializers.variance_scaling` with `distribution="truncated_normal"`](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.nn.initializers.variance_scaling.html).

Even if the user notices the discrepancy, it takes attention to detail to customize correctly. Take
the `imagenet_vit` workload of AlgoPerf <d-cite key="Dahl2023AlgoPerf"></d-cite>, for example. The
[PyTorch implementation](https://github.com/mlcommons/algorithmic-efficiency/blob/86d2a0d23c9a3192f878406edc72547fcf0568ec/algorithmic_efficiency/workloads/imagenet_vit/imagenet_pytorch/models.py)
makes sure that query, key, and value projection matrices are separate and always re-initializes [`torch.nn.Linear`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Linear.html)
layers with [`xavier_uniform_()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.init.html#torch.nn.init.xavier_uniform_).
It zero-inits the classification head by default and attempts to
[take the effect of truncation on standard deviation into account](https://github.com/mlcommons/algorithmic-efficiency/blob/86d2a0d23c9a3192f878406edc72547fcf0568ec/algorithmic_efficiency/init_utils.py#L15-L16)
for weight initialization. [`trunc_normal_()` of PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.init.html#torch.nn.init.trunc_normal_),
however, defaults to truncation at $\pm 2$ instead of $\pm 2$ standard deviation, so the resulting
weight ends up almost untruncated:

```python
>>> from algorithmic_efficiency.workloads.imagenet_vit.imagenet_pytorch.models import ViT
>>> from algorithmic_efficiency.workloads.imagenet_vit.workload import decode_variant
>>> vit = ViT(**decode_variant('S/16'))
>>> for w in [vit.conv_patch_extract.weight, vit.pre_logits.weight]:
...   print(w.min(), w.max())
...
tensor(-0.2119, grad_fn=<MinBackward1>) tensor(0.1907, grad_fn=<MaxBackward1>)
tensor(-0.2749, grad_fn=<MinBackward1>) tensor(0.2512, grad_fn=<MaxBackward1>)
```

compared to the [JAX implementation](https://github.com/mlcommons/algorithmic-efficiency/blob/86d2a0d23c9a3192f878406edc72547fcf0568ec/algorithmic_efficiency/workloads/imagenet_vit/imagenet_jax/models.py):

```python
>>> import jax.numpy
>>> import jax.random
>>> from algorithmic_efficiency.workloads.imagenet_vit.imagenet_jax.models import ViT
>>> from algorithmic_efficiency.workloads.imagenet_vit.workload import decode_variant
>>> vit = ViT(**decode_variant('S/16'))
>>> x = jax.numpy.zeros((1, 224, 224, 3), jax.numpy.float32)
>>> params = vit.init(jax.random.key(0), x)
>>> for w in [params['params']['conv_patch_extract']['kernel'], params['params']['pre_logits']['kernel']]:
...   print(w.min(), w.max())
...
-0.08204417 0.08203908
-0.11602508 0.116011634
```
Since they use the same initialization utility, the PyTorch implementation of the [`fastmri`](https://github.com/mlcommons/algorithmic-efficiency/blob/86d2a0d23c9a3192f878406edc72547fcf0568ec/algorithmic_efficiency/workloads/fastmri/fastmri_pytorch/models.py#L75), [`ogbg`](https://github.com/mlcommons/algorithmic-efficiency/blob/86d2a0d23c9a3192f878406edc72547fcf0568ec/algorithmic_efficiency/workloads/ogbg/ogbg_pytorch/models.py#L97), and [`imagenet_resnet`](https://github.com/mlcommons/algorithmic-efficiency/blob/86d2a0d23c9a3192f878406edc72547fcf0568ec/algorithmic_efficiency/workloads/imagenet_resnet/imagenet_pytorch/models.py#L210) workloads are also affected.

In the narrow sense, we have
shown that the discrepancies in RandAugment and Inception crop implementations impact model performance.
Some CV people are aware of the RandAugment issues, but again it requires tremendous attention to detail
to keep implementations consistent across ecosystems. As an example: the `imagenet_vit` workload of AlgoPerf <d-cite key="Dahl2023AlgoPerf"></d-cite>
makes sure that the RandAugment implementations have the same transform lineup and use the same neutral gray
fill value. However, the Contrast transform bug of the JAX implementation [remains unfixed](https://github.com/mlcommons/algorithmic-efficiency/blob/86d2a0d23c9a3192f878406edc72547fcf0568ec/algorithmic_efficiency/workloads/imagenet_resnet/imagenet_jax/randaugment.py#L139). The PyTorch counterpart [simply calls](https://github.com/mlcommons/algorithmic-efficiency/blob/86d2a0d23c9a3192f878406edc72547fcf0568ec/algorithmic_efficiency/workloads/imagenet_resnet/imagenet_pytorch/randaugment.py#L108)
torchvision's [`F.adjust_contrast()`](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/generated/torchvision.transforms.functional.adjust_contrast.html) for the correct transform,
so the RandAugment ends up not exactly the same.

In our opinion though, the Inception crop discrepancy is probably the most severe issue.
Given its deep root in training deep image models, it has potentially broad implications and remains
undocumented to our best knowledge. Tracking down the commit histories, we find that the schism between
the implementations goes back 8 years, almost as old as the paper <d-cite key="szegedy2015going"></d-cite> itself:

* [`sample_distorted_bounding_box()` has remained unchanged](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/f3a77378b4c056e76691c5eba350a022c11e00d4).
* Hardcoded 10 sampling attempts and uniform crop area sampling [have been the same for `RandomSizedCrop()`](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/commit/d9b8d003d282904461d30e60b9e13ed2f74f3bc6).

Below are some of the papers that we know are affected, the context in which the TF implementation
of Inception crop is mentioned, and its current Google Scholar citation counts:

It is out of scope to retrain these models with the correct Inception crop, but we can compare the
90ep Head: MLP → linear models we trained with either the correct uniform area sampling:

* "Fixed": the model trained on a single RTX 3080 Laptop (77.27% top-1)
* "Fixed Parallel": the model trained on 8x A100-SXM4-40GB (76.83% top-1)

or the TF-like uniform crop height sampling:

* "Repro": the true reproduction model (76.94% top-1)
* "Grafted" # 3: a PyTorch model trained on the Big Vision data pipelines (76.72% top-1)

Loosely inspired by guided backpropagation <d-cite key="DBLP:journals/corr/SpringenbergDBR14"></d-cite>,
we compute the gradient of the class logit on the images from the ImageNet-1k validation set, sum over
gradients of the 3 (RGB) channels per pixel, and then zero-out the negative ones. Finally, we measure
how evenly the positive gradient is distributed among the $224^2$ pixels of the validation image center
crop by the entropy ([notebook](https://github.com/EIFY/mup-vit/blob/51bcdc77ea6e26ceef049e96f59702a9d9ef15d1/notebooks/gather_stats.ipynb)).
We hypothesize that since the correct Inception crop tends to let the model see more of the image,
How focused the model's attention (in the colloquial sense here) may differ. For reference and sanity
check, the maximum possible entropy here is $\log(224^2) = 10.82$ <d-footnote>An old version of this figure mistakenly used a grafted model trained in bfloat16 precision (the one in the <a href="https://huggingface.co/EIFY/ViT_Baseline_Revisited/tree/main/05-15_2003">05-15_2003 folder on HF</a>) and failed to take flipped image height and width into account.

We find that both data pipeline and Inception crop implementation matter. Reproduction with TF-like
Inception crop and torchvision data pipeline results in notably higher positive gradient entropy,
while both the correct Inception crop and the Big Vision data pipeline lower it. For the former,
we hypothesize that perhaps the smaller crops of TF-like Inception crop force the model to learn
different localized features in each epoch, so when the model sees the validation set center crop
it is paying more evenly distributed attention. For the latter some difference is not unexpected
given the subtle effects of data pipeline we observed, but we have even less insight.

Now, how would the models trained for the highly-cited papers above including SimCLR, SoViT-400M,
and FlexViT behave differently if they were trained with the correct Inception crop?

## Conclusion

We wish that things just worked — The same models, the same layers, the same initializations, and the
same data augmentations mean the same things across ecosystems — but that is not the world we live in.
To get closer to that world, all of us need to be more proactive in documenting discrepancies and
fixing bugs in existing implementations.

And our own repo should be no exception.

### Replication guide

Selected model checkpoints are available on Hugging Face [here](https://huggingface.co/EIFY/ViT_Baseline_Revisited).

1. [Install PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), including torchvision.
2. Prepare the [ILSVRC 2012 ImageNet-1k dataset](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/generated/torchvision.datasets.ImageNet.html).
3. `git clone https://github.com/EIFY/mup-vit.git`
4. `pip install wandb` or make changes to use your preferred logging platform.
5. `pip install schedulefree` or `git checkout add6d47` in the repo if you don't plan to run Schedule-Free experiments.
6. Depending on your machine:
   * Multi-node, multi-GPU:
    The code is intended to support but currently not tested on a multi-node, multi-GPU setup.
   * Single-node, multi-GPU:
    Say the ImagNet-1k dataset is at `/data/ImageNet/`. Just point `MUPVIT_MAIN` to `main.py` in the repo and run the bash script [`scripts/baseline_revisited.sh`](https://github.com/EIFY/mup-vit/blob/213a229852d65dbaf494ecb982540c804b607c46/scripts/baseline_revisited.sh):

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    MUPVIT_MAIN=~/Downloads/mup-vit/main.py
    PYTHON=torchrun
    N_WORKERS=80
    N_THREADS=124

    for EPOCH in 90 150 300
    do
        NUMEXPR_MAX_THREADS=$N_THREADS $PYTHON $MUPVIT_MAIN /data/ImageNet/ --workers $N_WORKERS --multiprocessing-distributed --epochs $EPOCH --batch-size 1024 --torchvision-inception-crop --mlp-head --report-to wandb --name better-baseline-${EPOCH}ep
    done
    # (...)
    ```

    Remove `--torchvision-inception-crop` for faithful replication of <d-cite key="beyer2022better"></d-cite>, i.e. with TF-like Inception crop.
    Experimentally step/s hits a plateau with 64-112 workers on a Lambda 8x A100-SXM4-40GB instance. Adjust both `N_WORKERS`
    and `N_THREADS` for your machine.

   * Single-node, single-GPU:
    Replace `torchrun` with `python` and remove `--multiprocessing-distributed`. You may need to use gradient accumulation to make sure $$\left( \frac{\text{batch-size}}{\text{accum-freq}} \right)$$ samples fit in the GPU RAM:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    MUPVIT_MAIN=~/Downloads/mup-vit/main.py
    PYTHON=python
    N_WORKERS=4
    ACC_FREQ=8

    for EPOCH in 90 150 300
    do
        $PYTHON $MUPVIT_MAIN /data/ImageNet/ --workers $N_WORKERS --epochs $EPOCH --batch-size 1024 --accum-freq $ACC_FREQ --torchvision-inception-crop --mlp-head --report-to wandb --name better-baseline-${EPOCH}ep
    done
    # (...)
    ```

    Warning: On a single GPU these experiments will likely take a long time.
7.
