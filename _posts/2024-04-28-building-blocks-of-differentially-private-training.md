## Introduction
      

Differential privacy (DP) is a powerful mathematical framework that allows us to reason about privacy in any process that takes input data and produces some output. Whether we're computing simple statistics, training machine learning models, or generating synthetic data, DP provides quantifiable privacy guarantees by carefully introducing randomness into our computations.

In this post, we'll just focus on a particular instance of DP: training a neural networks with differential privacy guarantees for the training data. Why should you care? Consider these scenarios:

- Medical records being used to train diagnostic systems
- Private messages helping improve language models
- Financial transactions training fraud detection algorithms

In each case, we have a process that takes sensitive individual data points as input and outputs model parameters that could potentially reveal information about that training data. A successful deployment can bring huge social benefits if the model works well, but it could also lead to ugly privacy breaches if the training data can be inferred.

We'll explore this challenge through a concrete, minimalist example: training a two-layer neural network on simple classification dataset with DP guarantees. While simple, we try to illustrate some of the challenges and solutions in DP deep learning. Specifically, we'll consider DP guarantees over individual training examples - meaning an observer shouldn't be able to tell whether any particular image-label pair was used during training, even with complete access to the model parameters.

*Why this blog:* the main motivation of this blog is to introduce DP in a concrete but simple setting. Even in this very simple setting, training a DP model requires a set of tricks. By introducing a selected highly useful subsets of these tricks, we aim to give the broader community a very limited, yet not completely out-of-touch, perspective on the progress and challenges of DP training. For a broader guide on DP and some best practices, we recommend the review <d-cite key="ponomareva2023dpfy"></d-cite>.


## Some Foundations of Differential Privacy

In principle, DP is about plausible deniability. The key insight is this: an observer shouldn't be able to determine whether any particular individual datapoint was used to train a model, even if they:

- Have complete access to the model's parameters
- Know all other training data
- Have unlimited computational power

This protection should also holds true regardless of what other information the observer might have. That's a nice list of requirement, let's try to be more concrete and introduce the definition.   

> **Definition** A randomized algorithm $$M$$ is said to satisfy $$(\varepsilon, \delta)$$-differential privacy if for:
> - Any two neighbouring datasets $$D$$ and $$D'$$ that differ by just one record
> - Any set of possible outputs $$S$$
> The following inequality holds: $$P(M(D) \in S) \leq e^\varepsilon \cdot P(M(D') \in S) + \delta$$

Going back to our goal and our list of requirements, we have $$M$$ being the learning algorithm taking in a dataset and outputting the model parameters. The definition says that changing any single record in the input dataset can only change the probability of any outcome by a multiplicative factor $$e^\varepsilon$$ (plus a small additive term $$\delta$$). This addresses our requirement as:
- The "any two datasets differing in one record" tackles the case where the attacker knows all but one record
- The "any set of outputs $$S$$" requirement protects against attackers with arbitrary auxiliary information, since they can check any property of the output<d-footnote> For more detailed discussion on auxiliary information check section 2 of <d-cite key=dwork2014algorithmic></d-cite>.</d-footnote>
- The probabilistic guarantee holds regardless of computational power. Arbitrary computations can be used to construct the set $$S$$ and the dataset $$D'$$ which differs by a single record from a protected dataset

For some more clarity, let's forget about $$\delta$$ for a moment setting it to $$0$$. Then, for any $$D$$ and $$D'$$ differing by a datapoint, we have that the above guarantee is equivalent to:

$$\begin{equation}  \ln\left(\frac{ P(M(D) \in S)}{ P(M(D') \in S)}\right) \leq \varepsilon, \;\;\;  \forall S\subseteq \text{range}(M) .\end{equation}$$

For a small $$\varepsilon$$, an observer looking at the output of $M$ is not able to reason if a specific datapoint was in the input of $$M$$, as the change of a single datapoint does not alter the probability distribution of the output significantly. Now let's consider $$\delta >0$$. This regime may be interpreted as instead of requiring the above ratio in (1) to always hold to only require it to hold with high probability.

> **Key Result 1** (Appendix A. <d-cite key=kasiviswanathan2014semantics></d-cite>) If a mechanism $$M$$ is $$(\varepsilon/2, \delta)$$-DP, then for any neighbouring datasets $$D$$, $$D'$$ we have:
>$$\begin{equation}
>P\left\{ \ln\left(\frac{ p_{D}(O)}{p_{D'}(O)}\right) \geq  \varepsilon\right\}\leq  \frac{\delta}{1-e^{-\varepsilon/2}}
>\end{equation} $$
> where $$p_{D}$$ and $$p_{D'}$$ are the distributions of $$M(D)$$ and $$M(D')$$ respectively. The probability is taken over $$o\sim p_D$$.

This result shows that an $$(\varepsilon, \delta)$$-DP guarantee can be interpreted as high-probability bound on the ratio between the log probabilities of the outputs corresponding to two neighbouring datasets. This ratio is actually called the privacy loss and plays a critical role in the analysis of DP mechanisms. 

> **Definition**  For a mechanism $$M$$ and neighbouring datasets $$D,D'$$, the privacy loss random variable is defined as:
> $$L(M,D,D') = \ln\left( \frac{ p_{D}(O)}{p_{D'}(O)}\right)$$
> with support $$\mathbb{R}\cup\{\infty\}$$ and where $$O$$ is drawn according to $$p_D$$. 

As shown by **Key Result 1**, the privacy loss variable enables us to interpret the $$\delta$$ of an $$(\varepsilon, \delta)$$ mechanism. However, a similar result exists in the reverse direction and often plays an important role. The reverse direction is particularly useful when proving that a mechanism is differentially private.

> **Key Result 2** (Lemma 3.17 <d-cite key=dwork2014algorithmic></d-cite>) If for all neighbouring datasets $$D,D'$$, a mechanism $$M$$ satisfy $$P(L(M,D,D') > \varepsilon) \leq \delta$$, then $$M$$ is $$(\varepsilon,\delta)$$-DP 

In other words, if we can show that the privacy loss is bounded by $$\varepsilon$$ with high probability (≥ 1-$$\delta$$), then the mechanism satisfies $$(\varepsilon,\delta)$$-DP<d-footnote> Note that the other direction does not strictly hold as the reverse statement in Key Result 1 is weaker.</d-footnote>. In addition, the above two results also provide insights on the appropriate values of $$\delta$$ and $$\varepsilon$$. Generally, $$\varepsilon$$ indicates the strength of the guarantee and $$\delta$$ signifies the probability of the privacy catastrophically breaking. Thus, we often require $$\delta$$ to be very small. Ideally, $\varepsilon$ should be around or smaller than $1$ so that the ratio between the two probability of outcomes under two datasets differing by a record stays small. However, in practice, $$\varepsilon=1$$ is relatively hard to obtain.

### A Practical Example: Private Mean Estimation

We defined DP but how does it works in practice? Consider computing the average of sensitive data. Suppose we want to compute the average salary of a group of people while protecting individual's privacy. Simply releasing the exact average could leak information about individuals, especially in small datasets and considering the power that we already given to the observer of having access to all but one record of the dataset. The solution is rather simple; adding Gaussian noise. 

Let's assume that we have $$n$$ clients in the dataset and that all salaries are bounded by $$B$$ and we want $$(\varepsilon, \delta)$$-DP mean computation. We can

1. Compute the true mean: $$\mu = \text{average}(\text{clip}_B(\text{data}))$$
2. Add random noise: $$\text{result} = \mu + \frac{B}{n}\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma(\varepsilon, \delta)^2)$$
3. Release the noisy $$\text{result}$$

In the above, the $$\text{clip}_B$$ sets any salary above $$B$$ to $$B$$ for ensuring that we process the data incase our assumption does not hold. Also, $$\sigma(\varepsilon, \delta)$$ is some function of $$\varepsilon$$ and $$\delta$$ that sets the noise according to the privacy level we want. We will spend the next subsection discussing $$\sigma(\varepsilon, \delta)$$ but for now let's see the usefulness of this approach. For this we fix:
- Failure probability $$\delta = 10^{-6}$$ 
- Dataset size $$n = 10,000$$ employees
- Salary bound $$B = \$1,000,000$$

Then, we can look at the relation between $$\varepsilon$$ and the $$\sigma$$ needed for mean computation to be $$(\varepsilon, \delta)$$-DP.

</div> -->

For a better idea on the utility, looking at $$\varepsilon = 1/2$$, $$\sigma\approx 806$$. In turn this means that: About 68% of the time, our reported average will be within $$806$$ of the true mean.  About 95% of the time, it will be within $$1,612$$. Whether this is sufficient utility or not depends on the reason for computing the average, but it may be enough to get a decent idea about the average salary within a company. 


### The Gaussian Mechanism and Its Analysis

The process of adding Gaussian noise is usually called the Gaussian mechanism, which is an extremely fundamental building block of DP. First, we define the sensitivity of a function. 

>**Definition:** For a function $$f:\mathcal{D}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$$ computing a vector-valued statistic from a dataset, we define its sensitivity as   
> $$\Delta_f  = \max_{D ,D':|D\setminus D'|=1} \|f(D) - f(D') \|_2 $$
> where the condition $$|D\setminus D'|=1$$ indicates that $$D$$ and $$D'$$ only differ by a single record. 

Then, for a function $$f$$ with sensitivity $$\Delta_f$$ and required $$(\varepsilon,\delta)$$-DP level, the Gaussian,mechanism calculates the needed $$\sigma$$ and adds a noise drawn from $$\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2I)$$ to the output of $$f$$. Then, the Gaussian mechanism is 

$$M(x) = f(x) + \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2I).$$

For a simple version of the Gaussian mechanism, we may set $$\sigma = \frac{\Delta}{\epsilon}\sqrt{2\ln(1/\delta)+2\varepsilon}$$ <d-footnote>For $\epsilon<1$, the folklore result is more refined and states that we can set $\sigma = \frac{\Delta}{\epsilon}\sqrt{2\ln(1.25/\delta)}$ <d-cite key=dwork2014algorithmic></d-cite>. The version we have here follows from the same derivation as the folklore result but using a couple of brute bounds to avoid the need for $\varepsilon>1$</d-footnote> to ensure $$(\varepsilon,\delta)$$-DP. While we wont prove this bound, its derivation depends on analysing the privacy loss random variable. The critical step is to show that when a Gaussian noise with covariance $$\sigma^2 I$$ is added, the privacy loss random variable satisfy 

$$
\begin{equation}
L(M,D,D')  \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\frac{\|f(D)-f(D')\|_2^2}{2\sigma^2}, \frac{\|f(D)-f(D')\|^2_2}{\sigma^2} \right)
\end{equation}
$$
Finally, applying a tail bound on the Gaussian tail allows us to specify a sufficiently large $$\sigma$$ so that 
$$
P(L(M,D,D') > \varepsilon) \leq \delta.
$$
This in turns allow us to prove the $$(\varepsilon, \delta)$$ guarantee by **key result 2**.

While this value of $$\sigma$$ is sufficient for ($$\varepsilon, \delta$$)-DP, it is not necessary. In particular, the tail bound we applied during the proof may be loose for some value of $$\varepsilon$$ and $$\delta$$, resulting in a larger than needed $$\sigma$$. For example, in the blog  <d-cite key=PeiBlog1></d-cite>, Pei showed that the bound can be refined to 

$$\sigma \geq \Delta \cdot \min \left\{
\begin{array}{l}
\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\sqrt{2\log(1/\delta)} +2\varepsilon^{-\frac{3}{2}},   \\
\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\left(1\vee \sqrt{ (\log(2\pi)^{-1}\delta^{-2})_+} + {2\varepsilon^{-1/2}} \right) \\
\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\sqrt{\log(e^\varepsilon\delta^{-2})}  \\
\frac{1}{\varepsilon}(\sqrt{1+\varepsilon} \vee \sqrt{\log(e^\varepsilon(2\pi)^{-1}\delta^{-2})}_{+}) 
\end{array} .
\right\}$$

Taking this one step further, <d-cite key=balle2018analytic></d-cite> proposed to use numerical solver to get even tighter bounds on $$\sigma$$, naming this approach the Analytical Gaussian Mechanism. To illustrate the differences of these approaches, we plot the values of $$\sigma$$ computed using them on our mean salary example.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/2024-04-28-building-blocks-of-differentially-private-training/three_sigma.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div> 
</div>

Taking another look at our example of computing the mean salary, we find out that for $$\varepsilon=0.5, \delta=10^{-6}$$, we get $$\sigma\approx 1051$$ with the original version, $$\sigma\approx 1026$$ with Pei's refinement, and $$\sigma\approx 806$$ with the analytic version. Crucially, all of those values give the same privacy guarantee, we just measure it in better ways.


> 📝 **The key takeaway message here** and the reason we went into the details of the Gaussian mechanism is not to show what's the best way to implement the Gaussian mechanism. **It is to illustrate that in DP:**
>1. We really care about tighter bounds as: **tighter bounds** ->  **less noise** -> **more useful results with same privacy**
>2. In cases where it is possible to leverage numerical solvers to get tighter bounds, we are happy to do so. 

The above two points are very important in both DP practice and research. While closed form bounds and asymptotic are useful in gaining intuition or proving the (non)optimality of some methods, most state of the art DP implementations are attained using numerical solvers and numerous tricks to calibrate as tightly as possible the noise magnitude and compute the privacy guarantee.

## From Gaussian Mechanism to DP-SGD

### 3.1 Privatizing Gradient Descent

Now that we introduced basic notions and tools of DP, let's go back to our goal of training a neural network on a simple dataset, starting with the fundamental optimization algorithm in machine learning - gradient descent (GD). Given a dataset $$D = \{z_1,...,z_k\}$$ and a model $$f_\theta$$ parameterized by $$\theta$$, GD aims to minimize the empirical risk $$R(f_\theta,D) = \sum_i R(f_\theta,z_i)$$ through iterative updates:

**Algorithm: Gradient Descent (GD)**
* **Input**: Initial parameters $\theta_0$, Dataset $D := \{z_1,...,z_k\}$, learning rate $\eta$, number of steps $T$
* **For** $$t = 1$$ to $$T$$ **do**:
  1. Compute gradient: $$g_t = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i\in[N]} \nabla_{\theta_{t-1}} R(f_{\theta_{t-1}},z_i)$$
  2. Update parameters: $$\theta_t = \theta_{t-1} - \eta g_t$$
* **Output**: $$\theta_T$$

Let's first consider the simplest case: $$T=1$$, i.e., we just want to take a single gradient step. The tools, which we have developed with the Gaussian mechanism, allow us to do this! To see how, let's analyze the sensitivity of a single gradient computation after the initialization. We assume that the adversary already knowns $$\theta_0$$. Then, our privacy depends on the only step accessing the data, i.e. our query function is:
$$f(D) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i\in [N]} \nabla_{\theta_0} R(f_{\theta_0},x_i).$$

The challenge is that gradients could be arbitrarily large, making the sensitivity unbounded. However, we can fix this by clipping the individual gradients to a maximum $$\ell_2$$ norm $$C$$. This gives us
$$f(D) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i\in [N]} \text{clip}_C(\nabla_{\theta_0} R(f_{\theta_0},z_i)).$$

Where $$\text{clip}_C(x):={\min(1, C/\|x\|_2)}{x}$$. This gives us bounded sensitivity of $2C/N$ for the averaged gradient. Now we can apply the Gaussian mechanism by adding an appropriately scaled Gaussian noise to make a single DP gradient step.

**Algorithm: Private Gradient Descent (One Step)**
* **Input**: $$\theta_0$$, $$D$$, learning rate $$\eta$$, noise scale $$\sigma$$, clip threshold $C$
  1. For each $$i$$, compute: $$\tilde{g}_i = \text{clip}_C(\nabla R(f_{\theta_0},z_i))$$
  2. Average: $$\bar{g} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_i \tilde{g}_i$$
  3. Add noise: $$\hat{g} = \bar{g} + \mathcal{N}(0,(4\sigma^2C^2/N^2)I)$$
  4. Update: $$\theta_1 = \theta_0 - \eta\hat{g}$$
* **Output**: $$\theta_1$$

### 3.2 The Challenge of Multiple Steps: Adaptive Composition 

In practice, training requires many gradient steps, a single gradient step gets us nowhere. Since each step accesses the data, we need to account for **cumulative privacy loss** through successive computations. In addition, each computation (gradient step) requires the output of the previous computation. What we showed in the previous subsection is that through clipping and noise addition, we are able to make a single gradient step satisfy DP. Thus, what we need is a method to calculate the $(\varepsilon_{\text{tot}}, \delta_{\text{tot}})$-DP guarantees of a mechanism, which works by combining and iteratively executing multiple $$(\varepsilon, \delta)$$ mechanisms. Let's define this more formally:

**Definition (Adaptive Composition)**: Let $$M_1,...,M_k$$ be mechanisms where each $$M_i$$ takes both dataset $$D$$ and auxiliary input and the outputs of all previous mechanisms. Their adaptive composition is $$M_{[k]}(D):=(o_1, \ldots, o_k)$$, where
1. $$o_1 = M_1(D)$$,
2. $$o_2 = M_2(D,o_1)$$,
3. $$o_3 = M_3(D,o_1,o_2)$$
and so on.

    </div> 
</div>
<div class="caption">
  Illustration of the composition of multiple mechanisms. Each mechanism access the data and all the outputs of the previous mechanisms.
</div>

Let's interpret how gradient descent with many steps fits within the adaptive composition framework. We set the $i$-th step of gradient descent as $$M_i$$, taking the output of the previous gradient steps and accessing the data to compute the new parameters $$\theta_{i}$$. Then, $$M_{[k]}$$ is the mechanism that releases all the model checkpoints $$\theta_1,\ldots, \theta_k$$ <d-footnote>for the setting where only the final outcome is released check <d-cite key=feldman2018privacy></d-cite>.</d-footnote>. Therefore, requiring a privacy guarantee on the adaptive composition of gradient steps is to protect against adversaries seeing the entire parameter trajectory, not just the final model. This strong guarantee is often desirable since:
- Training checkpoints are commonly saved for monitoring convergence, early stopping, ensembling
- Models may be fine-tuned from intermediate checkpoints
- In federated learning, updates are explicitly shared with all participating agents<d-footnote>Note that the notion of DP used in federated learning is usually slightly different than the one we are using. Indeed. the guarantee is usually not with respect $D$ and $D'$ differing by one datapoint, but instead $D$ and $D'$ differ by all the datapoints belonging to a single user. This is well explained in <d-cite key=ponomareva2023dpfy></d-cite>  </d-footnote>.


Finally, going back to our goal of calculating $$(\varepsilon_{\text{tot}}, \delta_{\text{tot}})$$, we can achieve this using the the advanced composition theorem:

>**Theorem (Advanced Composition)**<d-cite key=dwork2014algorithmic></d-cite>: The $$k$$-fold adaptive composition of $$(\varepsilon,\delta)$$-DP mechanisms satisfies $$(\varepsilon',k\delta+\delta')$$-DP where. $$\varepsilon' = \varepsilon\sqrt{2k \ln(1/\delta')} + k\varepsilon(e^\varepsilon - 1)$$ <d-footnote> This is not tight. For the tight bound check <d-cite key=kairouz2015composition></d-cite>.</d-footnote>.

#### A first try at DP training:

After introducing the advanced composition theorem, we technically have all the ingredients for a first trial to train a small two layer neural network on a simple dataset. For our model we will use a simple two-layer neural network with RelU activation and $$128$$ hidden units. For the data, we will use $$5000$$ randomly sampled images from MNIST. To train our model with DP, we first need to set the hyperparameters $$C$$ (clipping norm) and $$T$$ (number of iteration). Then, after picking the privacy guarantee we want by setting $$\varepsilon$$ and $$\delta$$, we can use the Gaussian mechanism along with advanced composition result to calculate the magnitude of Gaussian noise required at each iteration. 

In fact, we may make use of a handy result from <d-cite key=kairouz2015composition></d-cite>, which state that to get $(\varepsilon,\delta)$ it is sufficient to have each inner Gaussian mechanism satisfy $(\varepsilon_0, \delta_0)$ with $\varepsilon_0 = \frac{\varepsilon}{2\sqrt{T\log(e + \varepsilon/\delta)}}$ and $\delta_0 = \frac{\delta}{2T}$. We can then use $\varepsilon_0$ and $\delta_0$ to calculate the amount of noise we need to have. However, we are left with two hyperparameters to tune $C$ and $T$. For the gradient clipping $C$, one common heuristic to tune it is to run the training without any DP, measure the distribution of the gradient norms, and pick $C$ so that we are doing some clipping but not a lot of clipping<d-footnote>This is a bit vague. It is hard to be very specific about hyperparameters tuning intuitions. On a side note, in the wider machine learning community, gradient clipping is being used to stabilize training. The critical difference is that we are computing the average of clipped gradients, while the (wider used) gradient clipping is often a clipping of the average gradients.</d-footnote>. $T$ can also be tricky to tune. For a larger $T$, we are able to train longer but we need to use smaller $\varepsilon_0$ and $\delta_0$ forcing us to add more noise at each iteration.

To get some intuition of the tuning of $C$ and $T$, let's try a training run without any DP to see the gradients norms and the loss curves. We run gradient descent with learning $0.01$ for $5000$ iterations. For the gradients norm, the $95\%$ quantile is around $32$ and very low number of gradient go above $40$. For the sake of round numbers, let's take $C=30$ <d-footnote>One may want to do better hyperparameter tunning in practice but this blog is for illustrations only</d-footnote>

<div class="caption">

</div>
Now let's look at the test loss and accuracy. In the no DP setting, it looks like we should not train for more than $3000$ iterations. Also, very little progress occurs after $1000$.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">

    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">

</div>

Now, going back to our goal of DP training, depending on the number of iterations $$T$$, let's try to calculate the noise level $$\sigma$$ needed for $$\varepsilon=1$$, $$\delta=10^{-6}$$, and $$C=30$$. 
<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">

    </div>
</div>
That's actually a lot of noise to inject into GD. Let's just try training for $$100$$ iterations to see the current state of progress.

Well it's not particularly good...


### 3.3 Tighter Analysis via Renyi Differential Privacy

Can we do better? Given that this blog exists, the answer is probably yes. The advanced composition theorem, while powerful, is mechanism-agnostic - it gives a worst-case bound that must hold for any sequence of $$(\varepsilon,\delta)$$-DP mechanisms. For the Gaussian mechanism specifically, we can do much better.

Recall from our analysis of the Gaussian mechanism that the privacy loss random variable follows a Gaussian distribution:

$$L(M,D,D') \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\frac{\|f(D)-f(D')\|_2^2}{2\sigma^2}, \frac{\|f(D)-f(D')\|_2^2}{\sigma^2}\right)$$

We also showed that to prove $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-DP, it suffices to bound the tails of this privacy loss random variable:

$$P(|L(M,D,D')| > \varepsilon) \leq \delta$$

This suggests that if we can characterize the distribution of the privacy loss random variable more precisely, we might get tighter privacy guarantees. This leads us to Rényi Differential Privacy (RDP)<d-cite key=mironov2017renyi></d-cite>, which bounds the log moments of the privacy loss random variable:

**Definition**: A mechanism $$M$$ satisfies $$(\alpha,\varepsilon)$$-RDP if for all neighbouring datasets $$D,D'$$:
$$D_\alpha(M(D)||M(D')) := \frac{1}{\alpha-1}\log\mathbb{E}\left[\exp((\alpha-1)L(M,D,D'))\right] \leq \varepsilon$$

For the Gaussian mechanism with noise scale $$\sigma\Delta_f$$, we can show that it satisfies $$(\alpha,\frac{\alpha}{2\sigma^2})$$-RDP for all $$\alpha > 1$$ <d-footnote>What we just stated here is acutally concentrated differential privacy, we dont explore it in details. It is very closely related to RDP and can be also used to get very similar tight bounds on the compositions of Gaussian mechanisms in practice, for more, check <d-cite key=bun2016concentrated></d-cite>.</d-footnote>. Importantly, each RDP guarantee implies a family of $$(\varepsilon,\delta)$$-DP guarantees through the following conversion theorem:

**Theorem (RDP Conversion)**<d-cite key=mironov2017renyi></d-cite>: If $$M$$ is $$(\alpha,\varepsilon)$$-RDP, then for any $$\delta > 0$$, $$M$$ also satisfies $$(\varepsilon + \frac{\log(1/\delta)}{\alpha-1}, \delta)$$-DP.

This means that each moment bound on the privacy loss random variable captures a different tradeoff between $\varepsilon$ and $$\delta$$. Nonetheless, the key advantage of RDP is its much cleaner composition theorem:

**Theorem (RDP Composition)**<d-cite key=mironov2017renyi></d-cite>: If $$M_1$$ is $$(\alpha,\varepsilon_1)$$-RDP and $$M_2$$ is $$(\alpha,\varepsilon_2)$$-RDP, then their adaptive composition is $$(\alpha,\varepsilon_1+\varepsilon_2)$$-RDP.

Thus to compose a series of RDP mechanism, we can simple add there epsilons. The Gaussian mechanism has another remarkable property - it simultaneously satisfies RDP at all orders $$\alpha > 1$$ with:

$$\varepsilon(\alpha) = \frac{\alpha}{2\sigma^2}.$$

As a result, for any sequence of $$k$$ Gaussian mechanisms with noise scale $$\sigma \Delta_f$$, we achieve $$(\alpha, \frac{k\alpha}{2\sigma^2})$$-RDP for all $$\alpha > 1$$. Converting to $$(\varepsilon,\delta)$$-DP, this gives us a family of guarantees:

$$\left(\frac{k\alpha}{2\sigma^2} + \frac{\log(1/\delta)}{\alpha-1}, \delta\right).$$

For any choice of $$\alpha > 1$$ and $$\delta > 0$$. Different values of $$\alpha$$ give us different tradeoffs - looking at the bound, larger $$\alpha$$ values may work better for small $$\delta$$.


Given that the Gaussian mechanism satisfies RDP for an infinite list of alphas and that each $$\alpha$$ gives rise to an an infinite list of $$(\varepsilon, \delta)$$-DP algorithms, a naturally arising question is: which $$\alpha$$ should we pick. Again the answer here is leveraging automatic solvers to find the best possible $$\alpha$$ for us. For example, if we want to calculate the DP privacy guarantee of the $$T$$ times composition of the Gaussian mechanism, a typical workflow for using these automatic solvers is to give them the noise level $$\sigma$$, the sensitivity $$\Delta_f$$ of the function we are trying to make DP, and the number of times $$T$$ we are composing this mechanism. Then, through a mixture of symbolic and numerical solutions, the solver will aim to find the best possible $$\varepsilon$$ for a given $$\delta$$ by trying a long list of candidate alphas. Another possible workflow is to give the solver the $$\varepsilon, \delta, \Delta_f$$, and $$T$$ and then to get the smallest possible $$\sigma$$ needed. All of this in the hope of getting the tightest possible bounds. Thus, the theme of using numerical method, which we first saw with the Analytic Gaussian mechanism, strikes back. Throughout this blog, we will be using the RDP accounting tools of Google dp-accounting library <d-footnote>Check https://pypi.org/project/dp-accounting Tighter DP accounting can be possible by using the Privacy Loss Distribution (PLD) accounting tools of the library, which leverages <d-cite key=doroshenko2022connect></d-cite>. For the experiments, we used the RDP accountant to stay closer to the content.</d-footnote>.


#### A second try at DP training: 

Armed with RDP and it's cleaner composition result, let's retry the experiments of the last subsection. 

<div class="row mt-3">

    </div>
</div>

This is more encouraging. We need a way smaller noise for the same exact privacy guarantees. Let's be brave and try training for $$T=200$$ steps this time. 

<div class="row mt-3">f

Well, we are actually able to train!
### 3.4 The Power of Subsampling: From GD to SGD

In practice, we rarely use full GD, preferring stochastic gradient descent (SGD) which operates on random minibatches. Beyond very small datasets on simple models, SGD is indispensable as trying to use the full dataset at each iteration makes the computations completely infeasible. In particular, SGD subsamples a random minibatch at the start of each training iteration. However, a critical issue with subsampling is the expanded sensitivity. To illustrate, let's reconsider our earlier example of computing the mean salary of $$n=10^4$$ employees. The sensitivity of this data query scales with $$\mathcal{O}(1/n)$$. Consider an alternative strategy to estimate the average the salary by first sampling the salary of $$250$$ employees and then computing the average using only the sampled salaries. In this sampling approach, the worst-case sensitivity for a datapoint may scale proportionally with $$1/250$$. As typically $$250\ll n$$, this forces us to add even more noise to maintain the same privacy guarantee. 

Nonetheless, implementing a differentially private SGD is still possible. Subsampling itself, under some conditions, can be shown to provide privacy benefits through **privacy amplification by subsampling**. Hence, the stochasticity of SGD makes each step more private, essentially allowing us to train with less noise. As a result, the tradeoff of increased sensitivity along with subsampling privacy amplification typically cancels out enabling us to use SGD<d-footnote>  This tradeoff between amplification by subsampling and increased sensitivity was recently studied in <d-cite key=2024subsampling></d-cite>.</d-footnote>, wich almost the same amount of noise per iteration, independantly of the batch size. In practice, SGD is implemented by using a random batch with fixed batch-size at each iteration. For the following section, we will assume a different sampling strategy, which we will refer to as Poisson subsampling. We assume that given a dataset, at each step of SGD, each datapoint is independently at random selected for training with probability $$q$$. 

For the Gaussian mechanism specifically, when we combine:
- Poisson subsampling with rate $$q$$
- Gaussian noise with scale $$\sigma\Delta_f$$

We get the following RDP guarantee:

**Theorem (Informal)**<d-cite key=mironov2019r></d-cite>: For $$\alpha > 1$$, the subsampled Gaussian can satisfy $$(\alpha,\frac{q^2\alpha}{\sigma^2})$$-RDP <d-footnote>This statement is only proved under certain conditions on $\sigma$ and $\alpha$. Again, in practice, we will be using a numerical method to get a tight characterization.</d-footnote>.

This $$O(q^2)$$ factor is crucial as $$q$$ is usually quite small in practice. Combined with RDP composition, this enables us to use much smaller noise for the same privacy guarantee. 

Those building blocks allow us to finally recover the DP-SGD algorithm<d-cite key=abadi2016deep></d-cite>:
1. Randomly sample batch with rate $$q$$
2. Clip the gradient for each example.
3. Average and add $$\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2 I)$$ noise
4. Update parameters
5. Track privacy via RDP composition<d-footnote>Technically the original DP-SGD was not introduced with the framework of RDP but with the moment accountant. Motivated by the structure of Gaussian noise, the authors proposed an algorithm to track the composition of Gaussian mechanisms through the moments of the privacy loss random variable. Later, RDP was introduced in <d-cite key=mironov2019r></d-cite>, which in some sense generalized the approach of tracking composition through the moment behavior of the privacy loss random variable. For a nice discussion on this and a substantially more rigorous results on the amplification by subsampling of RDP, check <d-cite key=Wang_Balle_Kasiviswanathan_2021></d-cite>  </d-footnote>


#### A third try at DP training. 

The tight analysis through RDP and privacy amplification allows training SGD with reasonable noise scales. For example, let's try to train for the previous setting with a subsampling rate $$q=0.05$$.
 <div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/2024-04-28-building-blocks-of-differentially-private-training/subsampled_rdp_comp.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

Using subsampling, we get a basically the same noise levels for SGD as GD. However, it must be noted that the figures we have are also a function of the numerical solver we are using to compute the $$\sigma$$ for a given setting. Here, as we previously state, we are using the RDP accountant of the Google dp-accounting library. Using tighter numerical solvers, we can actually show that subsampling allows us to add less noise, especially at smaller values of $$T$$ and $$q$$.




Let's try another training trial this time with SGD.

## Beyond DP-SGD: Using Correlated Noise

While DP-SGD with privacy amplification has become the standard approach for differentially private deep learning, it faces significant limitations:

1. **Reliance on Privacy Amplification**: Privacy amplification through subsampling requires strong assumptions on how data is processed. In many cases, the data may not fit in memory and sampling each datapoint with equal probability is not feasible.

2. **Suboptimal Noise Addition**: DP-SGD treats each gradient step independently, potentially leading noise accumulation. For the sake of illustration, consider the case where the gradients are constant. Then, then the noise of DP-SGD, added independently at each iteration, will keep accumulating. 

If not DP-SGD, what else can we do? Well, a growing line of work investigates adding **correlated noise** instead of independent noise at each iteration. To our knowledge, using this idea for training neural networks was first explored in <d-cite key=kairouz2021practical></d-cite><d-footnote> Prior to <d-cite key=kairouz2021practical></d-cite>, the idea of using correlated noise was studied in the streaming setting of DP <d-cite key=dwork2010differential></d-cite>. A brief summary of this setting and its application to SGD can be found in <d-cite key=denisov2022improved></d-cite></d-footnote>. In the rest of this blog, we will look at the matrix factorization mechanism <d-cite key=choquette2023multiMF></d-cite>, which is a specific mechanism that allows us to train DP models while adding correlated noise through the iterations. 

### 4.1 Putting Gradient Descent in Matrix Form

To understand the matrix factorization mechanism, let's first look at how standard gradient descent can be viewed in matrix form. Consider training for $$T$$ steps with learning rate $$\eta$$. At each step $$t$$, gradient descent computes:

$$\theta_t = \theta_{t-1} - \eta \nabla L_t(\theta_{t-1}).$$

After $$T$$ steps:

$$\theta_T = \theta_0 - \eta\sum_{t=1}^T \nabla L_t(\theta_{t-1}).$$

This summation can be rewritten using matrices. Let's stack all gradients into a matrix $$G$$:

$$G = \begin{bmatrix} \nabla L_1(\theta_0) \\ \nabla L_2(\theta_1) \\ \vdots \\ \nabla L_T(\theta_{T-1})\end{bmatrix}.$$

The parameter trajectory can then be written using a lower triangular matrix:

$$\begin{bmatrix} \theta_1 \\ \theta_2 \\ \vdots \\ \theta_T \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \theta_0 \\ \theta_0 \\ \vdots \\ \theta_0 \end{bmatrix} - \eta\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\ 1 & 1 & \cdots & 0 \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ 1 & 1 & \cdots & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \nabla L_1(\theta_0) \\ \nabla L_2(\theta_1) \\ \vdots \\ \nabla L_T(\theta_{T-1}) \end{bmatrix}.$$

Let's denote this lower triangular matrix by $$A$$, i.e,

$$A := \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\ 1 & 1 & \cdots & 0 \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ 1 & 1 & \cdots & 1 \end{bmatrix}.$$


Then we can write all iterations of gradient descent in a the more compact form

$$\Theta = \Theta_0 - \eta AG,$$

such that $$\Theta_0$$ is the matrix with all rows set to $$\theta_0$$ and $$i$$-th row of $$\Theta$$ is $$\theta_i$$. Here, $$A$$ encodes how past gradients influence current parameters. Each row of $$A$$ represents which gradients have been accumulated up to that step.

### 4.2 DP-SGD in Matrix Form

Now, let's consider DP-SGD, which adds noise at each step:

$$\theta_t = \theta_{t-1} - \eta(h_t + z_t)$$

where $$z_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2I)$$ and $$h_t$$ is the stochastic clipped gradient at iteration $$t$$. Again, we can write in a more vectorized form, as

$$\begin{bmatrix} \theta_1 \\ \theta_2 \\ \vdots \\ \theta_T \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \theta_0 \\ \theta_0 \\ \vdots \\ \theta_0 \end{bmatrix} - \eta A \left(\begin{bmatrix}h_1\\ h_2 \\ \vdots \\  h_T \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} z_1 \\ z_2 \\ \vdots \\ z_T \end{bmatrix}\right).$$

Alternatively, we may also express this in the more compact form as $$\Theta = \Theta_0 - \eta A(H + Z)$$ with matrix $$Z$$ being the stacking of all noise vectors. 

One drawback of DP-SGD is independent noise accumulation. To see why correlating noise across steps could help, let's analyze how noise accumulates in DP-SGD versus alternative schemes. Consider a simple case where we make two steps, then

$$\theta_2 = \theta_0 - \eta(h_1 + z_1) - \eta(h_2 + z_2).$$

Since $$z_1$$ and $$z_2$$ are independent, the total noise variance is $$2\eta^2\sigma^2$$. More generally, after $$k$$ passes, the variance grows linearly with $$k$$.
Now consider an alternative scheme where  $$z_1 = -z_2$$, then 
$$\theta_2 = \theta_0 - \eta(h_1 + h_1) $$

The noise cancels out. However, clearly releaseing $$\theta_2$$ offers no privacy guarantees at all.  While this specific scheme isn't DP, it illustrates how correlating noise across steps that process the same data could reduce total variance. Then, the question becomes how to do so in a DP way.

### 4.3 The Matrix Factorization Framework

Let's try to generalize and to take a wider perspective on DP-SGD. From writing it in matrix form, we can understand DP-SGD as a method to compute $$AH$$ in a DP way by outputing

$$\widehat{AH} = A(H+Z),$$

with a noise matrix $$Z$$. The key insight is that we can factorize $$A = BC$$. Again, our goal is still to report a DP version of $$AH$$.  However, we can now do it in an alternative way by using

$$\widehat{AH} = B(CH+Z).$$

Here, we shift the placement of the DP mechanism to make it on the computation of $$CH$$. Since, $$A$$ is independent of the data, $$B$$ is also independent of the data. So if $$CH$$ is computed in a DP way so will $$BCH=AH$$. Then, if $$C$$ is invertible, we can equivalently rewrite this as 

$$\widehat{AH} = A(H+C^{-1}Z).$$

This is acutally what we want as the noise: the matrix $$C^{-1}Z$$ is made from correlated noise. Assuming we factorize $$A=BC$$ with $$B=A$$ and $$C=I$$. Then, the above statement reduces to 

$$\widehat{AH} = A(H+C^{-1}Z) =  AH+AZ.$$

This is essentially how DP-SGD works. Remember, that for our application, the $$i$$-th row of $$H$$ is the $$i$$-th gradient vector. In addition,  each row of $$Z$$ is an independent realization from $$\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2 I)$$. If we want to add correlated noise, we need to have $$C^{-1}\neq I$$. Now, the question is finding a factorization $$A=BC$$ such that 

1. $$C$$ is invertible
2. $$C^{-1}$$ has a noise correlation structure that makes as much as possible of the total noise cancel out, in order words, optimizes the utility result. 
3. Evaluate the needed scale $$\sigma$$ of the noise $$Z$$, such that $$CH+Z$$, or equivalently, $$H+C^{-1}Z$$ is $$(\varepsilon,\delta)$$-DP

In other words, various choices of $$(C, \sigma)$$ can be made to ensure $$(\varepsilon,\delta)$$-DP, and some result in a better utility than the one choice $$C=I$$.

Finding $$B$$ and $$C$$ to achieve the above goals is non-trivial. Again, we strongly rely on numerical solvers to find the best $$B$$ and $$C$$ and correspondingly calculate the required $$\sigma$$ for $$(\varepsilon, \delta)$$-DP. For details, refer to <d-cite key=choquette2023multiMF></d-cite> and <d-cite key=choquette2024amplifiedMF></d-cite>. Crucially, the computations for the decomposition of $$B$$ and $$C$$ is typically independant of the gradient matrix $$H$$. Some consideration on using the approaches of <d-cite key=choquette2023multiMF></d-cite> and <d-cite key=choquette2024amplifiedMF></d-cite> are:
- Be carefull how you sample: we used Poisson sampling for DP-SGD, i.e., at each iteration, each datapoint is randomly selected with some fixed probability. We need to be careful how we sample datapoints with the matrix factorization setting. You cannot just plug the Poisson subsampling. In particular, when computing $$(\varepsilon, \delta)$$ guarantees, we must account  for the maximum number of times any datapoint is used in gradient computations and a sampling structure where a datapoint cannot participate in gradient computations less than $$b$$ steps apart. Violating either will invalidate the privacy analysis.
- Subsampling amplification: one advantage of matrix factorization is that it is competitive with DP-SGD even without fully relying on any privacy amplification through subsampling<d-cite key=choquette2023multiMF></d-cite>. A privacy amplification through subsampling for the matrix factorization was introduced in  <d-cite key=choquette2024amplifiedMF></d-cite>. With this amplification, in the settings tested in the paper, the matrix factorization mechanism was always Pareto optimal with repect to the privacy-accuracy tradeoff. Again, one should be careful with subsampling amplifications as they should be implemented in a way that does not violate the previous remark.


#### Structure of $$B$$ and $$C$$. 


To illustrate a possible structure of the matrices $$B$$ and $$C$$. We use the matrices computed and released by <d-cite key=choquette2024amplifiedMF></d-cite>.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/2024-04-28-building-blocks-of-differentially-private-training/matrix_structure.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
Figure generated from the code of C.A. Choquette-Choo, et al. <d-cite key=choquette2024amplifiedMF></d-cite>
</div>


Note that we strongly care about the structure of $$C^{-1}$$ as it modulates the correlation between the noise added at different iterations. Thus, let's plot the distribution of the elements in $$C^{-1}$$. 
<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/2024-04-28-building-blocks-of-differentially-private-training/distribution_c_inv.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

While most elements are zero, we can observe a positive and a negative cluster. The negative cluster allows for negative correlation between noise added at different iterations, which causes some of the noise to cancel out. Specifically, going back to our optimization setting, at iteration iteration $$i$$, the output of our mechanism is 

$$\theta_i = \theta_0 - \eta A_{[i,:]}(H+C^{-1}Z),$$

where $$A_{[i,:]}$$ is the $$i$$-th row of $$A$$. Thus, the total variance of the noise at iteration $$i$$ can be seen as scaling with $$(AC^{-1})_{[i,:]}$$. To illustrate the benefit of using a noise correlation matrix, i.e, $$C\neq I$$, we can plot $$(AC^{-1})_{[i,:]}$$ against $$A_{[i,:]}$$.


<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/2024-04-28-building-blocks-of-differentially-private-training/noise_acc.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

We can see that $$A_{[i,:]}$$ increases at a much higher rate as none of the noise cancels out. 

#### A fourth try at DP training


Now let's go back to the running MNIST training setting, where we train a two-layer neural network on a $$5000$$ images of MNIST with $$(\varepsilon, \delta)$$-DP for $$\varepsilon=1$$ and $$\delta=1e-6$$. For the matrices $$B$$ and $$C$$ and the calibration of $$\sigma$$, we used the tools released by <d-cite key=choquette2024amplifiedMF></d-cite>. For reference, with $$T=200$$, $$C=30$$, and a batchsize of $$25$$, we obtained $$\sigma \approx 4$$. This is a much higher noise scale than what we used with DP-SGD. However, as a lot of the noise cancel out, we are still able to train effectively.


<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/2024-04-28-building-blocks-of-differentially-private-training/mat_fact_train.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

This is competitive with DP-SGD. 

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored the building blocks of differentially private training through two main approaches:

- DP-SGD, which adds independent Gaussian noise at each iteration, with privacy amplification through careful subsampling
- Matrix factorization mechanisms, which enable carefully correlated noise across iterations through optimized encoder-decoder pairs 

Both approaches offer viable paths to private deep learning, with different tradeoffs. While DP-SGD remains simpler to implement, matrix factorization mechanisms like may achieve better privacy-utility tradeoffs in many settings. For practitioners looking to train neural networks with differential privacy, experimenting with both approaches may be valuable, as their relative performance can depend on factors like model architecture, dataset size, and privacy requirements.
