## Introduction

Causal inference offers a critical pathway to understanding complex systems by identifying cause-and-effect relationships. In neuroscience, determining how specific neural activities influence behaviors or pathologies is fundamental. However, applying causal inference methods to real-world data, especially in neuroimaging modalities like electroencephalography (EEG), presents unique challenges. This article explores how Time-Contrastive Learning (TCL), a nonlinear Independent Component Analysis (ICA) method, can address these challenges by leveraging temporal dynamics and source reconstruction.

## Challenges of Causal Inference in EEG

### Signal Mixing

Scalp-level EEG signals represent linear combinations of neural source activities, complicating the accurate inference of causal relationships. This mixing obscures the underlying dynamics of distinct brain regions.

### Non-Interventional Data

Unlike interventional data, which allows direct manipulation of variables, EEG data is largely observational. This limitation restricts the applicability of traditional causal methods reliant on interventions.

### Traditional Methods' Limitations

Standard methods like Granger causality often assume stationarity and linearity, which are at odds with the nonlinear, dynamic nature of brain activity. These methods are prone to spurious results and fail to capture intricate temporal dependencies.

## Time-Contrastive Learning (TCL)

TCL provides a promising alternative by leveraging the temporal structure of data. The method segments time-series data into windows, using segment indices as labels to train a feature extractor. This approach captures invariant patterns across temporal changes, enabling disentangled representations even in observational datasets.

## Results and Implications

### Simulated Data Validation

Our implementation of TCL validated its effectiveness by replicating key results from prior studies, showcasing its ability to disentangle meaningful components from synthetic datasets.

### EEG Analysis

When applied to EEG data, TCL-derived embeddings exhibited sparse and interpretable patterns. These results surpassed traditional methods like PCA, suggesting TCL's strength in identifying relevant brain activity components.

### Comparison with Source Reconstruction

Combining TCL with source-reconstructed EEG data demonstrated strong alignment between learned representations and cortical activity. This integration bridges the gap between scalp-level observations and true neural dynamics.

## Future Directions

1. **Dynamic Source Estimation**:
   Addressing the challenge of predefined source counts to adaptively model EEG's complexity.

2. **Cross-Modality Applications**:
   Extending TCL's application to other neuroimaging modalities like MEG and fMRI.

3. **Causal Predictions**:
   Evaluating TCL's utility in classifying neurological conditions or cognitive states to strengthen its role in neuroscientific discovery.

## Conclusion

While traditional causal inference faces significant hurdles in EEG analysis, TCL offers a promising pathway forward. By combining TCL with source reconstruction techniques, researchers can extract meaningful representations from non-interventional data, enabling a deeper understanding of brain dynamics. This approach represents a critical step toward realizing the potential of causal inference in neuroscience.
