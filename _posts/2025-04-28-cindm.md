## Introduction

Inverse Design is an optimization methodology. The idea is to optimize the system configuration based on the predefined objective is given. It flips the traditional process. For example, in material discovery <d-cite key="zunger2024inverse"></d-cite>, instead of starting with a material and calculate its properties, you start with the desired property (like a specific band gap or temperature behavior) and work backward to find or design the material that fits.

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/2025-04-28-cindm/example-image.png" class="example-image" %}

The applications of Inverse Design span many domains, including:

- **Aerodynamics**: Designs plane shapes to minimize drag by simulating air-fluid dynamics and boundary interactions<d-cite key="athanasopoulos2009drag"></d-cite>.
- **Underwater Robotics**: Optimizes robot shapes for reduced drag, energy efficiency, maneuverability, and acoustic performance<d-cite key="saghafi2020underwater"></d-cite>.
- **Nanophotonics**: Creates micro- and nano-scale structures for precise light interactions in lasers, data storage, chips, and solar cells<d-cite key="molesky2018nanophotonics"></d-cite>.
- **Battery Design**: Enables efficient battery interphases and optimizes charging protocols for high-performance<d-cite key="bhowmik2019battery"></d-cite>, long-life lithium-ion batteries<d-cite key="attia2020hyperparameter"></d-cite>.

However, inverse design faces challenges related to computational speed due to intensive conventional modeling and optimization, as well as navigating complex, hierarchical, and heterogeneous design spaces. This is especially true for intricate systems, such as rocket designs.

Recent advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence have opened up new possibilities for solving these problems more efficiently and accurately. AI models can explore high-dimensional spaces, providing unique solutions. However, deep learning-based surrogate models <d-cite key="allen2022inverse"></d-cite> often suffer from adversarial design modes, where the inferred design parameters are not physically plausible, despite excellent optimization performance. The method proposed by Wu et al. <d-cite key="wu2024compositional"></d-cite> addresses this issue using compositional diffusion models.

The background section briefly explains the inverse design problem, followed by a discussion of the *Compositional Generative Inverse Design* by Wu et al.

## Background

### The Basics of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)

A Partial Differential Equation (PDE) is a mathematical equation involving an unknown function with several variables and their partial derivatives with respect to independent variables <d-cite key="quarteroni2008numerical"></d-cite>.

Formally, a PDE can be written as:

$$
F \left(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n, u, \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_1}, \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_2}, ..., \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x_1^2}, \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x_1 \partial x_2}, ... \right) = 0,
$$

where $$u = u(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$$ is the unknown function, and $$F$$ is a given function.

**Classical numerical methods** (such as finite element and finite difference methods) <d-cite key="ferziger2001fdm"></d-cite> have been cornerstone techniques for solving PDEs:

- **Finite Element Method (FEM)**: A numerical technique that divides a domain into smaller, simpler parts called elements and uses basis functions (often polynomials) defined on these elements to approximate the solution of the PDE.
- **Finite Difference Method (FDM)**: This method approximates the derivatives in the PDE using finite difference approximations (e.g., forward, backward, or central differences). The domain is represented as a structured grid of points, and the PDE is solved at these grid points.

Numerical solvers discretize the continuous spatial and temporal domains into a finite set of points to approximate the solutions. Two key approaches include:

1. **Eulerian Scheme**: The spatial domain is discretized into a fixed grid. For example, the forward difference approximation of a spatial derivative is:

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} (x, t) \approx \frac{u(x + \Delta x, t) - u(x,t)}{\Delta x},
$$

where $$\Delta x$$ represents spatial grid spacing and $$x + \Delta x$$ are points on the computational mesh.

2. **Lagrangian Scheme**: The focus is on tracking particles as they move through the domain. Classical Lagrangian methods, such as Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) <d-cite key="monaghan1992sph"></d-cite>, are useful but face challenges such as particle clumping due to negative pressure.

Time-stepping methods advance solutions using either explicit or implicit schemes <d-cite key="ascher1995time"></d-cite>:
- **Explicit Method**: Directly computes the future state (e.g., forward Euler: $$u_{t+\Delta t} \approx u_t + \Delta t \partial_t u$$) but requires small step sizes for accuracy and stability.
- **Implicit Method**: Solves equations involving both current and future states for larger, stable steps but requires iterative solvers, increasing computational cost.

### Neural PDE Solvers

Deep Learning-based PDE solvers <d-cite key="butler2021artificial"></d-cite> significantly outperform classical numerical methods in terms of speed, scalability, and adaptability. Neural solvers can generalize across conditions, adapt to tasks, and learn directly from data, making them particularly valuable for complex or uncertain systems. They allow for larger time steps, use coarser grids, and leverage GPUs efficiently.

#### Problem Setup

Time-evolving PDEs describe how a system changes over space and time:

$$
\partial_t u  + \mathcal D (x, t, u, \partial_x u, \partial_{xx}u,...) = 0 \quad (x, t) \in U,
$$

$$
u(x, 0) = u_0(x) \quad x \in \mathbb{X},
$$

$$
\mathcal{B}u(x, t) = 0 \quad (x, t) \in \partial \mathbb{X} \times \mathbb{T},
$$

where:
- $$u(x, t)$$ is the unknown function (solution) over space ($$\mathbb{X}$$) and time ($$\mathbb{T}$$),
- $$D$$ is the differential operator relating derivatives of $$u$$,
- $$u_0$$ is the initial condition at $$t = 0$$,
- $$B$$ represents the boundary condition on the spatial domain's boundary ($$\partial \mathbb{X}$$).

The goal is to find $$u(x, t;\gamma)$$ that satisfies these equations, where $$\gamma$$ defines the problem setup (initial, boundary condition, and parameters). The objective function $$\mathcal{J}$$ measures the quality of the design:

$$
\dot\gamma = \underset{\dot\gamma}{\arg\min}\, \mathbb{E}_{x,t}[\mathcal{J}(u(x, t; \hat\gamma))]
$$

#### Deep Learning-based Inverse Design

Recent papers, such as *Inverse Design for Fluid-Structure Interactions Using Graph Network Simulators* by Allen et al. (2022) <d-cite key="allen2022inverse"></d-cite>, investigate how graph neural network (GNN) simulators can be used for effective inverse design. This approach combines GNNs with gradient-based optimization. However, gradient descent may be unsuitable for design spaces with regions of zero gradients, which can hinder generalization and compositionality.

#### Compositional Models

Compositional models combine multiple smaller, specialized models to solve complex tasks. Each model focuses on a specific part of the problem, and their outputs are merged. This approach is common in 3D synthesis<d-cite key="po2023synthesis"></d-cite>, trajectory planning <d-cite key="du2019trajectory"></d-cite> <d-cite key="urain2021planning"></d-cite>, and hierarchical decision-making <d-cite key="ajay2023decision"></d-cite>. A key challenge with compositional models is interpretability and error propagation, where mistakes in one component can affect the entire system <d-cite key="butler2021artificial"></d-cite>.

## Compositional Inverse Design using Diffusion Models (CinDM)

Wu et al.'s method introduces:
- **Novel Inverse Design Formulation**: Inverse design is treated as an energy optimization problem, enabling flexible and efficient design generation.
- **CinDM**: Compositional Inverse Design with Diffusion Models, which generalizes to complex and out-of-distribution inputs beyond the training set.

### Problem Formulation

This method uses an energy optimization perspective instead of relying on a surrogate model. By formulating this way, the method address a key issue with existing inverse design approaches, where the optimization process can easily fall out-of-distribution of the distribution of the design parameters seen during training.
  
This approach jointly optimize the design objective $$\mathcal J$$ and a generative objective $$E_\theta$$,

$$
\dot\gamma = \underset{\dot\gamma,U_{[0,T]}}{\arg\min}\, [E_\theta (U_{[0,T]}, \gamma + \lambda \mathcal J (U_{[0,T]}, \gamma) ],
$$

where $$E_\theta$$ is an energy-based model (EBM) <d-cite key="lecun2006energy"></d-cite> <d-cite key="du2019energy"></d-cite>, trained over joined distribution of trajectories $$U_{[0,T]}$$ (discrete version of $$u$$ as we don't have access to ground-truth model for dynamical system) and boundaries $$\gamma$$ and $$\lambda$$ is hyperparameter balancing the two objectives. 

We also need training loss to that used to train energy-based model $E_\theta$ using a diffusion objective. 

$$ 
L_{\text{MSE}} = \| \epsilon - \epsilon_{\theta}(\sqrt{1-\beta_s} z + \sqrt{\beta_s} \epsilon, s) \|_2^2, \quad \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I), 
$$

where:
- $$\epsilon_{\theta}$$ is the denoising network
- $$z$$ represents all variables in the design optimization ($$z = U_{[0, T]} ⊕ \gamma$$)
- $$s$$ is the diffusion step
- $$\beta_s$$ is a noise schedule parameter
- $$\epsilon$$ is Gaussian noise

The following equation represents a step in the Langevin sampling process used in the optimization <d-cite key="du2023langevin"></d-cite>. It iteratively updates the optimization variable $$z$$ to minimize the combined objective.

$$
z_{s-1} = z_s - \eta (\nabla_z (E_\theta(z_s) + \lambda J(z_s))) + \xi, \quad \xi \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_s^2 I),
$$

Where:
- $$z_s$$​: Current optimization variable.
- $$\eta$$: Step size.
- $$E_\theta$$​: Energy function modeling the system.
- $$J(z_s)$$: Design objective.
- $$\lambda$$: Hyperparameter weighting J(zs)J(z_s)J(zs​).
- $$\xi$$: Gaussian noise added to explore the space.

### Compositional Generative Inverse Design

The method enables generalization to more complex scenarios by composing energy functions $$E_\theta$$​ defined over subsets of the design variables $$z$$. Each subset enforces local physical consistency while their overlap ensures global consistency.

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/2025-04-28-cindm/cindm.png" class="cindm" %}

Figure 2 illustrates the **CinDM framework**, showcasing how compositional generative models optimize design variables. It combines generative models for subsets of inputs (trajectories and boundaries) to enable complex system design, generalizing beyond training data.

The pseudo algorithm is given as:

{% highlight python linenos %}

# Compositional Inverse Design with Diffusion Models (CinDM)
# Input: Diffusion models {ϵ_iθ}, design objective J(·), hyperparameters λ, S, K
# Output: Optimized design variables γ and trajectory U[0,T]

for s = S, ..., 1:
    # Langevin sampling steps at step s
    for k = 1, ..., K:
        ξ ∼ N(0, σ_s^2 I)  # Sample Gaussian noise
        z_s ← z_s - η * (1/N) * Σ_i [ϵ_iθ(z_s^i, s) + λ ∇z J(z_s)] + ξ
    
    ξ ∼ N(0, σ_s^2 I)  # Noise for next diffusion step
    z_s-1 ← z_s - η * (1/N) * Σ_i [ϵ_iθ(z_s^i, s) + λ ∇z J(z_s)] + ξ

return γ, U[0,T] = z_0  # Return optimized results

{% endhighlight %}

### Three Generalizations Covered in CinDM

1. **Generalization to Longer Time Steps**:  
   - Trajectories are split into overlapping intervals during training.  
   - At test time, the model combines these intervals to generate longer rollouts (e.g., 34, 44, or 54 steps).  
   - This enables accurate design for systems evolving over extended time horizons.

2. **Generalization to More Interacting Objects**:  
   - Pairwise energy functions learned from smaller systems (e.g., 2-body interactions) are composed to model larger systems (e.g., 4-body or 8-body).  
   - This allows CinDM to scale and handle more complex dynamics with many interacting entities.

3. **Generalization from Parts to Whole for Boundaries**:  
   - Design variables (e.g., shapes) are decomposed into parts during training, with individual energy functions for each part.  
   - At test time, the parts are composed into a whole system (e.g., multi-part structures like planes or airfoils).  
   - This supports designing more complex systems by leveraging local consistency across parts.

### Results

Here we compared the **CinDM's generalization capabilities** in different experimental settings. The experiments also extend to more complex designs, such as N-body problem and multi-airfoil configurations. 

##### **Compositional Inverse Design in Time & More Objects**
Test generalization to longer trajectories and systems with more interacting objects.  
- **Time Generalization:** Trained on 24 time steps, then tested on 34, 44, and 54 steps in N-body simulations (e.g., balls bouncing in a box).  
- **More Objects:** Trained on 2-body interactions and tested on 4-body and 8-body systems. The task was to minimize the final position distance to a target. 

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/2025-04-28-cindm/experiment1.png" class="experiment1" %}

Figure 3 shows the **trajectories designed by CinDM** for the N-body task in two different scenarios. In **(a)**, the system consists of 2 bodies, and the model is tasked with designing their trajectory to converge towards the center, showcasing the model's ability to maintain stability and optimize the design objective over 54 time steps. The darker circles represent later states in the trajectory. The central star marks the target position. In **(b)**, the model successfully handles the complexity of 4 interacting bodies in a more challenging setting. The trajectories are designed such that all bodies move towards the target position, with each body interacting with others in the system, showing CinDM's scalability to handle more objects while maintaining high accuracy in achieving the design objective.
 
- **Time Generalization:** CinDM significantly outperformed baselines (CEM <d-cite key="rubinstein2004simulation"></d-cite>, Backprop <d-cite key="allen2022inverse"></d-cite>) in both **trajectory accuracy** (MAE) and **design objectives**.
- **More Objects:** CinDM excelled at scaling to systems with more interacting bodies (4-body and 8-body), outperforming baselines in both accuracy and design objectives.

| Method                  | 4-body, 24 steps (MAE ↓) | 4-body, 44 steps (MAE ↓) | 8-body, 24 steps (MAE ↓) | 8-body, 44 steps (MAE ↓) |
|:-------------------------|:--------------------------:|:--------------------------:|:--------------------------:|:--------------------------:|

| **CinDM (Ours)**        | **0.03928**             | **0.03163**             | **0.09241**             | **0.09249**             |


##### **Compositional Inverse Design for Multiple Airfoils** 
Test generalization in high-dimensional spaces, particularly for multiple airfoils in aerodynamic design.
- Train on flow around a single randomly-sampled airfoil and then test on multiple airfoils, aiming to maximize the lift-to-drag ratio.  

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/2025-04-28-cindm/experiment2.png" class="experiment2" %}

Figure 4 illustrates the **formation flying strategy** discovered by CinDM for the multi-airfoil design task. In **(a)**, the model designs a two-airfoil system where the airfoils are positioned in a **"leader-follower" formation**, significantly reducing drag and improving aerodynamic performance. The design objective is achieved by optimizing the lift-to-drag ratio, which is enhanced by the positioning of the airfoils. In **(b)** and **(c)**, the comparison shows the performance of each airfoil flying separately, with higher drag and a lower lift-to-drag ratio. The visual representations show the fluid vorticity (represented by color) around the airfoils, with the optimized formation (a) leading to a more efficient flow and improved aerodynamic characteristics.

CinDM showed superior performance in terms of **lift-to-drag ratio** and design objective compared to other methods. It also discovered **formation flying**, reducing drag and increasing efficiency.

| Method                  | 1 Airfoil (Lift-to-Drag Ratio ↑) | 2 Airfoils (Lift-to-Drag Ratio ↑) |
|:-------------------------|:----------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------:|

| Backprop, FNO           | 1.3300                           | 0.9722                            |
| **CinDM (Ours)**        | **2.1770**                       | **1.4216**                        |


## Conclusion

The authors conclude that the Compositional Inverse Design with Diffusion Models (CinDM) method offers a novel and effective approach to compositional generative inverse design. This conclusion stems from CinDM's ability to compose trained diffusion models, focusing on subsets of design variables, and jointly optimize trajectories and boundaries. This allows CinDM to generalize and design systems of greater complexity than those encountered during training.

### Key takeaways

- **Compositionality is key**:
CinDM's ability to compose diffusion models trained on simpler design components enables it to tackle more complex systems at test time. This is highlighted by its successful generalization to longer time horizons, systems with more interacting objects, and the design of complex 2D airfoil shapes.
- **Generative approach for robust design**: 
By framing inverse design as an energy optimization problem within a generative framework, CinDM encourages physically consistent designs and avoids falling into adversarial modes, as observed in some baseline methods.
- **Wide applicability**: 
The authors believe that the CinDM approach can be applied to a wide range of inverse design problems beyond the examples presented in the sources. They suggest its potential use in material design, drug discovery, and molecule design.

### Ongoing Challenges

- **Complex Design Space**: 
Real-world design problems often involve complex systems with many components that can be combined in various ways. For example, in rocket design, the system includes an airframe, propulsion, and payload, each consisting of hundreds of parts. Representing and optimizing such a complex design space is a significant challenge.
- **Conflicting Objectives**: 
Engineering designs usually involve multiple objectives that can conflict with each other. For instance, in designing a phone battery, we want it to be both long-lasting and lightweight, but these goals often oppose each other, requiring a balanced solution.
- **Changing Importance of Objectives**: 
The importance of different objectives can change depending on the situation. For example, during a rocket launch, air resistance, fuel efficiency, and structural durability have different levels of importance as the rocket moves from the ground to space, creating varying optimization priorities.

### Remarks

In their paper "Compositional Generative Inverse Design," Wu et al. introduce a novel approach to inverse design through the use of compositional generative models, leveraging diffusion-based energy functions for optimization. The key contributions of this work are the introduction of a generative perspective to avoid adversarial design and the ability to generalize to more complex and unseen design scenarios, such as longer time steps and systems with more interacting components. The method enables efficient optimization without relying on autoregressive rollouts, and its compositional nature allows for the design of complex systems, like multi-airfoil configurations, by combining simpler learned models. Additionally, the approach introduces a compositional framework that can be applied to a wide range of design tasks, significantly enhancing the flexibility and performance of inverse design solutions.
